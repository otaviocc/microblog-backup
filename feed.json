				"title": "Reachability using NWPathMonitor and Combine",
				"content_html": "<p>About a month ago I decided to build a new app to attend a personal need, a desktop client for <a href=\"https://pinboard.in\">Pinboard</a>, a service I&rsquo;ve been using for over a decade to store and manage my bookmarks.</p>\n<p>As any application which requires internet to fetch and update data, my client needed a way to detect network accessibility. For a long time the strategy adopted by engineers in this situation was to rely on Apple&rsquo;s Reachability class, a sample code the company used to provide for download on their developer portal. Well, either that or one of the many CocoaPods frameworks the community built to replace Apple&rsquo;s drag-and-drop solution. But since iOS 12.0 and macOS 10.14 there&rsquo;s a powerfull first-party alternative.</p>\n<p>Introduced a couple of years ago, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpathmonitor\"><code>NWPathMonitor</code></a> is the easiest way to detect network changes (and retrieve connection properties). Its interface is extremely simple to use, providing a callback to get notified of updates.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-swift\" data-lang=\"swift\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> monitor = NWPathMonitor()\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> queue = DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background)\n\nmonitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">in</span>\n    print(path.status) <span style=\"color:#75715e\">// .unsatisfied, .satisfied, .requiresConnection</span>\n}\n\nmonitor.start(\n    queue: queue\n)\n\n<span style=\"color:#75715e\">// ...</span>\n\nmonitor.stop()\n</code></pre></div><p>My application in built in SwiftUI (2.0) and Combine and the solution above wouldn&rsquo;t <em>feel right</em> in my View Model. So I started with a simple wrapper, hiding the monitor and exposing a publisher which notifies path changes.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-swift\" data-lang=\"swift\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> wrapper = NWPathMonitorWrapper()\n\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> cancellable = wrapper\n    .pathUpdatePublisher()\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .sink { path <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">in</span>\n        print(path.status)\n    }\n\nwrapper.start()\n</code></pre></div><p>But the implementation (below) still requires <code>NWPathMonitorWrapper.start()</code> to be called, hurting the beauty of the publisher-subscriber relationship.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-swift\" data-lang=\"swift\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">public</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">final</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">class</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">NWPathMonitorWrapper</span> {\n\n    <span style=\"color:#75715e\">// </span><span style=\"color:#75715e\">MARK:</span><span style=\"color:#75715e\"> - Properties</span>\n\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">private</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> monitor: NWPathMonitor\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">private</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> queue: DispatchQueue = .global(qos: .background)\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">private</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> pathUpdateSubject = PassthroughSubject&lt;NWPath, Never&gt;()\n\n    <span style=\"color:#75715e\">// </span><span style=\"color:#75715e\">MARK:</span><span style=\"color:#75715e\"> - Life cycle</span>\n\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">public</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">init</span>(\n        monitor: NWPathMonitor = NWPathMonitor()\n    ) {\n        <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">self</span>.monitor = monitor\n        <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">self</span>.monitor.pathUpdateHandler = {\n            <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">self</span>.pathUpdateSubject.send($0)\n        }\n    }\n\n    <span style=\"color:#75715e\">// </span><span style=\"color:#75715e\">MARK:</span><span style=\"color:#75715e\"> - Public</span>\n\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">public</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">func</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">start</span>() {\n        monitor.start(\n            queue: queue\n        )\n    }\n\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">public</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">func</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">stop</span>() {\n        monitor.cancel()\n    }\n\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">public</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">func</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">pathUpdatePublisher</span>() -&gt; AnyPublisher&lt;NWPath, Never&gt; {\n        pathUpdateSubject\n            .eraseToAnyPublisher()\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>So I looked for a similar example in Apple&rsquo;s frameworks, one which requires a method to be called to trigger the action. Turns out <code>URLSession</code>, familiar to every iOS/macOS engineer, is the perfect example since it requires <code>URLSession.resume()</code> to be called to fire the network requrest. Recently <code>URLSession</code> got a new method, a <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/3329707-datataskpublisher\">publisher</a> which starts the request at the moment there&rsquo;s demand (a subscriber):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-swift\" data-lang=\"swift\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> session = URLSession.shared\n\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> cancellable = session\n    .dataTaskPublisher(<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">for</span>: request)\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .tryMap { result <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">in</span>\n        <span style=\"color:#75715e\">// ...</span>\n    }\n    .sink(\n        receiveCompletion: { <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">_</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">in</span> },\n        receiveValue: { <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">_</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">in</span> }    \n    )\n</code></pre></div><p>And that&rsquo;s the interface I wanted for my monitor. A simple publisher which starts <em>emitting values</em> as soon as there&rsquo;s demand.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-swift\" data-lang=\"swift\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> monitor = NWPathMonitor()\n\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> cancellable = monitor\n    .pathUpdatePublisher()\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .sink { path <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">in</span>\n        print(path.status)\n    } \n</code></pre></div><p>SwiftUI and Combine are new to me, I spiked and re-implemented some UI components I have up in my sleeve, but nothing too complex. Building this client is helping me to explore and learn new APIs.</p>\n<p>The protocols <code>Publisher</code>, <code>Subscriber</code>, and <code>Subscription</code> are examples of these APIs. To implement a custom publisher it&rsquo;s necessary to implement types conforming to two of these protocols.</p>\n<p>First, a quick recap:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher\"><code>Publisher</code></a> is the type which emits events over time,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber/\"><code>Subscriber</code></a> is the type which receives events published by the publisher, and</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscription\"><code>Subscription</code></a> implements the link between publishers and subscribers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first step was to define my publisher interface. Since the monitor requires a queue to run, I decided to pass the queue as argument. In order to simplify its interface, a background queue is passed by default to the implementation.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-swift\" data-lang=\"swift\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">extension</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">NWPathMonitor</span> {\n  \n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">public</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">func</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">pathUpdatePublisher</span>(\n        on queue: DispatchQueue = .global(qos: .background)\n    ) -&gt; NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher {\n      <span style=\"color:#75715e\">// ...</span>\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>The interface provides a hint of the first type to be implemented, <code>NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher</code>.

				"content_text": "About a month ago I decided to build a new app to attend a personal need, a desktop client for [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in), a service I've been using for over a decade to store and manage my bookmarks.\n\nAs any application which requires internet to fetch and update data, my client needed a way to detect network accessibility. For a long time the strategy adopted by engineers in this situation was to rely on Apple's Reachability class, a sample code the company used to provide for download on their developer portal. Well, either that or one of the many CocoaPods frameworks the community built to replace Apple's drag-and-drop solution. But since iOS 12.0 and macOS 10.14 there's a powerfull first-party alternative.\n\nIntroduced a couple of years ago, [`NWPathMonitor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpathmonitor) is the easiest way to detect network changes (and retrieve connection properties). Its interface is extremely simple to use, providing a callback to get notified of updates.\n\n```swift\nlet monitor = NWPathMonitor()\nlet queue = DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background)\n\nmonitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path in\n    print(path.status) // .unsatisfied, .satisfied, .requiresConnection\n}\n\nmonitor.start(\n    queue: queue\n)\n\n// ...\n\nmonitor.stop()\n```\n\nMy application in built in SwiftUI (2.0) and Combine and the solution above wouldn't *feel right* in my View Model. So I started with a simple wrapper, hiding the monitor and exposing a publisher which notifies path changes. \n\n```swift\nlet wrapper = NWPathMonitorWrapper()\n\nlet cancellable = wrapper\n    .pathUpdatePublisher()\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .sink { path in\n        print(path.status)\n    }\n\nwrapper.start()\n```\n\nBut the implementation (below) still requires `NWPathMonitorWrapper.start()` to be called, hurting the beauty of the publisher-subscriber relationship.\n\n```swift\npublic final class NWPathMonitorWrapper {\n\n    // MARK: - Properties\n\n    private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n    private let queue: DispatchQueue = .global(qos: .background)\n    private let pathUpdateSubject = PassthroughSubject<NWPath, Never>()\n\n    // MARK: - Life cycle\n\n    public init(\n        monitor: NWPathMonitor = NWPathMonitor()\n    ) {\n        self.monitor = monitor\n        self.monitor.pathUpdateHandler = {\n            self.pathUpdateSubject.send($0)\n        }\n    }\n\n    // MARK: - Public\n\n    public func start() {\n        monitor.start(\n            queue: queue\n        )\n    }\n\n    public func stop() {\n        monitor.cancel()\n    }\n\n    public func pathUpdatePublisher() -> AnyPublisher<NWPath, Never> {\n        pathUpdateSubject\n            .eraseToAnyPublisher()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo I looked for a similar example in Apple's frameworks, one which requires a method to be called to trigger the action. Turns out `URLSession`, familiar to every iOS/macOS engineer, is the perfect example since it requires `URLSession.resume()` to be called to fire the network requrest. Recently `URLSession` got a new method, a [publisher](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/3329707-datataskpublisher) which starts the request at the moment there's demand (a subscriber):\n\n```swift\nlet session = URLSession.shared\n\nlet cancellable = session\n    .dataTaskPublisher(for: request)\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .tryMap { result in\n        // ...\n    }\n    .sink(\n        receiveCompletion: { _ in },\n        receiveValue: { _ in }    \n    )\n```\n\nAnd that's the interface I wanted for my monitor. A simple publisher which starts *emitting values* as soon as there's demand.\n\n```swift\nlet monitor = NWPathMonitor()\n\nlet cancellable = monitor\n    .pathUpdatePublisher()\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .sink { path in\n        print(path.status)\n    } \n```\n\nSwiftUI and Combine are new to me, I spiked and re-implemented some UI components I have up in my sleeve, but nothing too complex. Building this client is helping me to explore and learn new APIs.\n\nThe protocols `Publisher`, `Subscriber`, and `Subscription` are examples of these APIs. To implement a custom publisher it's necessary to implement types conforming to two of these protocols.\n\nFirst, a quick recap:\n\n* [`Publisher`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher) is the type which emits events over time,\n* [`Subscriber`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber/) is the type which receives events published by the publisher, and\n* [`Subscription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscription) implements the link between publishers and subscribers.\n\nThe first step was to define my publisher interface. Since the monitor requires a queue to run, I decided to pass the queue as argument. In order to simplify its interface, a background queue is passed by default to the implementation.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n  \n    public func pathUpdatePublisher(\n        on queue: DispatchQueue = .global(qos: .background)\n    ) -> NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher {\n      // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe interface provides a hint of the first type to be implemented, `NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher`. Most of the code is boilerplate, and for this publisher, the `Output` expected is `NWPath`, without a `Failure`.\n\nWhen the publisher *receives* a subscriber, the link between them is established.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n   \n  public struct PathMonitorPublisher: Publisher {\n\n        // MARK: - Nested types\n    \n        public typealias Output = NWPath\n        public typealias Failure = Never\n    \n        // MARK: - Properties\n    \n        private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n        private let queue: DispatchQueue\n    \n        // MARK: - Life cycle\n    \n        fileprivate init(\n            monitor: NWPathMonitor,\n            queue: DispatchQueue\n        ) {\n            self.monitor = monitor\n            self.queue = queue\n        }\n    \n        // MARK: - Public\n    \n        public func receive<S>(\n            subscriber: S\n        ) where S: Subscriber, S.Failure == Failure, S.Input == Output {\n            let subscription = PathMonitorSubscription(\n                subscriber: subscriber,\n                monitor: monitor,\n                queue: queue\n            )\n    \n            subscriber.receive(\n                subscription: subscription\n            )\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `Subscription` fulfills the demand from the subscriber. As soon as there's demand, it starts monitoring changes using the monitor's callback, passing changes to the subscriber. And since `Subscription` conforms to [`Cancellable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/Cancellable), `cancel()` can be used to stop the monitor.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n\n    private final class PathMonitorSubscription<\n        S: Subscriber\n    >: Subscription where S.Input == NWPath {\n\n        // MARK: - Nested types\n  \n        private let subscriber: S\n        private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n        private let queue: DispatchQueue\n  \n        // MARK: - Life cycle\n  \n        init(\n            subscriber: S,\n            monitor: NWPathMonitor,\n            queue: DispatchQueue\n        ) {\n            self.subscriber = subscriber\n            self.monitor = monitor\n            self.queue = queue\n        }\n  \n        // MARK: - Public\n  \n        func request(\n            _ demand: Subscribers.Demand\n        ) {\n            guard\n                demand == .unlimited,\n                monitor.pathUpdateHandler == nil\n            else {\n                return\n            }\n  \n            monitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path in\n                _ = self.subscriber.receive(path)\n            }\n  \n            monitor.start(\n                queue: queue\n            )\n        }\n  \n        func cancel() {\n            monitor.cancel()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith all in place, the View Model becomes extremely simple and elegant. Below a View Model which publishes a boolean indicating the connectivity status to the View.\n\n```swift\nfinal class ViewModel: ObservableObject {\n\n    // MARK: - Properties\n\n    @Published var isConnected: Bool = false\n    private var monitorCancellable: Cancellable?\n\n    // MARK: - Life cycle\n\n    init(\n        pathMonitorPublisher: NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher\n    ) {\n        monitorCancellable = pathMonitorPublisher\n            .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n            .map { $0.status == .satisfied }\n            .assign(to: \\.isConnected, on: self)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOverall, I'm happy with the result, and am looking forward to using Combine (and SwiftUI) in production.\n\nResources:\n\n* [Using Combine](https://heckj.github.io/swiftui-notes/)\n* [Introducing Combine](https://www.apeth.com/UnderstandingCombine/start.html)\n",

				"content_text": "Like them or not, [type methods](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Methods.html), aka *class methods* or *static methods*, are heavily used in Swift and part of our daily lives as developers. \n\nFrom analytics trackers to requesting system permissions, we‚Äôve all had to face type methods from external libraries in which we had no control over. Testing code that interacts with them might seem hard without using [method swizzling](http://nshipster.com/method-swizzling/), but fortunately, this doesn't always have to be the case.\n\nLet's suppose there's a class called `APIWrapper`, which implements a type method that requests search results from an endpoint.\n\n```swift\npublic class APIWrapper {\n    public static func search(\n        query: String,\n        completion: @escaping (Result<[String], Error>) -> Void\n    )\n}\n```\n\nThe method takes a query, `String`, and a completion block, `(Result<[String], Error>) -> Void`, which is triggered once the request finishes. Its internal implementation doesn't really matter since it could be from an external framework or generated by a [code generator](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) from the API specification.\n\nConsuming the method is straightforward:\n\n```swift\nAPIWrapper.search(query: \"fancy restaurant\") { result in\n    // do something with 'result'\n}\n```\n\nBut testing the part of the application that interacts with it isn't that obvious. Especially when we want to:\n\n1. avoid making real network requests\n2. stress all the possibilities the interface allows. For instance:\n   - Is the search method called with the correct query string?\n   - What happens when the completion block returns an empty array?\n   - What happens when the completion block returns an array of results?\n   - What happens when the completion block is called with an error?\n\n### **Basic Data Source implementation**\n\nThe snippet below shows `SearchResultsTableViewDataSource`, a `UITableViewDataSource` subclass which uses the API wrapper to populate the table view when the network request completes. Testing it triggers a real network request and doesn't provide what's needed to test the query passed to the wrapper and the different behaviors when the result returns.\n\n```swift\nfinal class SearchResultsTableViewDataSource: NSObject,\n                                              UITableViewDataSource {\n    private let tableView: UITableView\n    private var results: [String] = []\n\n    init(\n        tableView: UITableView\n    ) {\n        self.tableView = tableView\n    }\n\n    func fetchSearchResuls(query: String) {\n        APIWrapper.search(\n            query: query\n        ) { [weak self] result in\n            switch result {\n            case .success(let results): self?.results = results\n            case .failure: self?.results = []\n            }\n            self?.tableView.reloadData()\n        }\n    }\n\n    // ... UITableViewDataSource methods ...\n}\n```\n\nIf `APIWrapper` had an instance method instead of a type method, two easy and obvious solutions would emerge: *protocols* and *subclasses*. Using either/or it would be possible to replace the wrapper with a [test double](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html) that captures the query parameter and completion block for verifying expectations.\n\n### **Dependency injection to the rescue**\n\nIn the example above, the API wrapper interface can't be changed and has to stay as a type method, therefore the easiest way to overcome this is via [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection). In this case, *method injection* via object initialization\n\nThe code below stores a method which matches the qualified symbol name of the wrapper method, using it to perform the search. In order to simplify the `SearchResultsTableViewDataSource` interface, the wrapper's search method is assigned using a [default parameter value](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Functions.html#ID169).\n\n```swift\nfinal class SearchResultsTableViewDataSource: NSObject,\n                                              UITableViewDataSource {\n    typealias SearcherCompletion\n        = (Result<[String], Error>) -> Void\n    typealias Searcher\n        = (String, @escaping SearcherCompletion) -> Void\n\n    private let tableView: UITableView\n    private var results: [String] = []\n    private var searcher: Searcher\n\n    init(\n        tableView: UITableView,\n        searcher: @escaping Searcher = APIWrapper.search(query:completion:)\n    ) {\n        self.tableView = tableView\n        self.searcher = searcher\n    }\n\n    func fetchSearchResuls(query: String) {\n        searcher(query) { [weak self] result in\n            switch result {\n            case .success(let results): self?.results = results\n            case .failure: self?.results = []\n            }\n            self?.tableView.reloadData()\n        }\n    }\n\n    // ... UITableViewDataSource methods ...\n}\n```\n\n### **Testing with Dependency Injection**\n\nFinally, testing becomes trivial. The injected method is used to capture the query term and the completion block passed to the API wrapper. Once captured, these can be used to verify expectations.\n\n```swift\nfinal class SearchResultsTableViewDataSourceTests: XCTestCase {\n    var tableView: UITableView!\n    var dataSource: SearchResultsTableViewDataSource?\n    var lastSearchQuery: String?\n    var lastSearchCompletion:\n        SearchResultsTableViewDataSource.SearcherCompletion?\n\n    override func setUp() {\n        super.setUp()\n\n        tableView = UITableView()\n\n        dataSource = SearchResultsTableViewDataSource(\n            tableView: tableView\n        ) { query, completion in\n            self.lastSearchQuery = query\n            self.lastSearchCompletion = completion\n        }\n    }\n\n    func testFetchSearchResultsQuery() {\n        // When the method is called\n        dataSource?.fetchSearchResuls(query: \"Mocked Search Query\")\n\n        XCTAssertEqual(\n            lastSearchQuery,\n            \"Mocked Search Query\",\n            \"It calls the API wrapper with the correct search query\"\n        )\n    }\n\n    func testFetchSearchResultsWithoutResults() {\n        // When the method is called\n        dataSource?.fetchSearchResuls(query: \"Mocked Search Query\")\n\n        // And the API wrapper completion block is called with an empty array\n        lastSearchCompletion?(.success([]))\n\n        XCTAssertEqual(\n            dataSource?.tableView(tableView, numberOfRowsInSection: 0),\n            0,\n            \"It empties the table view\"\n        )\n    }\n\n    func testFetchSearchResultsWithResults() {\n        // When the method is called\n        dataSource?.fetchSearchResuls(query: \"Mocked Search Query\")\n\n        // And the API wrapper completion block is called with results\n        lastSearchCompletion?(.success([\"result 1\", \"result 2\"]))\n\n        XCTAssertEqual(\n            dataSource?.tableView(tableView, numberOfRowsInSection: 0),\n            2,\n            \"It adds the correct number of results to the table view\"\n        )\n\n        XCTAssertEqual(\n            dataSource?.tableView(\n                tableView,\n                cellForRowAt: IndexPath(row: 0, section: 0)\n            ).textLabel?.text,\n            \"result 1\",\n            \"It configures the first cell\"\n        )\n\n        XCTAssertEqual(\n            dataSource?.tableView(\n                tableView,\n                cellForRowAt: IndexPath(row: 1, section: 0)\n            ).textLabel?.text,\n            \"result 2\",\n            \"It configures the second cell\"\n        )\n    }\n\n    func testFetchSearchResultsWithError() {\n        // When the method is called\n        dataSource?.fetchSearchResuls(query: \"Mocked Search Query\")\n\n        // And the API wrapper completion block is called with an error\n        enum MockError: Error { case someGenericError }\n        lastSearchCompletion?(.failure(MockError.someGenericError))\n\n        XCTAssertEqual(\n            dataSource?.tableView(tableView, numberOfRowsInSection: 0),\n            0,\n            \"It empties the table view\"\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\nMore importantly, not only does this method work with type methods but also with *free functions*, such as `SecItemAdd(_:_:)` used to [add items to the Keychain](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/1401659-secitemadd).\n",

Swift is a modern, powerful, and safe language. Its syntax is so simple and elegante that it works as an invitation to dive into the Functional Programming world.</p>\n<p>After practicing Functional Programming in Swift for a few weeks, I decided to try something a little bit different. I decided it was time to experiment with <em>curried functions</em>, <em>map</em>, <em>filter</em>, <em>sort</em>, and <em>reduce</em> in Objective-C.</p>\n<p>Swift collections implement <em>map</em>, <em>sort</em>, <em>filter</em>, and <em>reduce</em>, so the first step on my experiment was to reimplement these in a <code>NSArray</code> category, trying to match the method signature that Swift implements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Map</strong>: given a <em>transform operation</em>, it returns a new <code>NSArray</code> where all its elements are transformed according to the operation. The <em>transform operation</em> takes an object and returns another object (that might be of a different type of the original object).</li>\n<li><strong>Filter</strong>: given a <em>condition operation</em>, it returns a new <code>NSArray</code> where all its elements satisfy the condition.

				"content_text": "I strongly believe that the best way to learn something new is by experimenting and practicing it.\n\nA few months ago I was studying *Functional Programming in Swift*. Swift is a modern, powerful, and safe language. Its syntax is so simple and elegante that it works as an invitation to dive into the Functional Programming world.\n\nAfter practicing Functional Programming in Swift for a few weeks, I decided to try something a little bit different. I decided it was time to experiment with *curried functions*, *map*, *filter*, *sort*, and *reduce* in Objective-C.\n\nSwift collections implement *map*, *sort*, *filter*, and *reduce*, so the first step on my experiment was to reimplement these in a `NSArray` category, trying to match the method signature that Swift implements.\n\n* **Map**: given a *transform operation*, it returns a new `NSArray` where all its elements are transformed according to the operation. The *transform operation* takes an object and returns another object (that might be of a different type of the original object).\n* **Filter**: given a *condition operation*, it returns a new `NSArray` where all its elements satisfy the condition. The *condition operation* takes an object and returns a boolean.\n* **Sort**: given a *sort condition*, it returns a new `NSArray` where all its elements are sorted according to the condition. The *sort condition* takes two objects and returns a boolean.\n* **Reduce**: given a *combine operation*, it returns a recombined object by recursively processing its constituent parts. The *combine operation* takes the initial state and an object and returns a recombined object which is of the same type of the initial state.\n\nThe `NSArray` category ended up with the following interface:\n\n```objc\ntypedef id(^Transform)(id);\ntypedef BOOL(^Condition)(id);\ntypedef BOOL(^SortCondition)(id, id);\ntypedef id(^Combine)(id, id);\n\n[@interface](https://micro.blog/interface) NSArray (MFSR)\n\n- (NSArray *)map:(Transform)transform;\n- (NSArray *)filter:(Condition)condition;\n- (NSArray *)sort:(SortCondition)isOrderedBefore;\n- (id)reduce:(id)initial andCombine:(Combine)combine;\n\n@end\n```\n\nTo test the interface above and its implementation, I started with a immutable array of movies‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäJames Bond movies‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääloaded from a *plist* file.\n\n```objc\nNSArray<Movie *> *movies = [[NSBundle mainBundle] moviesFromPlist];\n```\n\nWhere each movie contains a title, the actor‚Äôs name who played Bond, and some additional information about about the flick. The movie interface is defined as:\n\n```objc\n@interface Movie : NSObject\n\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSString *title;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSString *actor;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSInteger year;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat boxOffice;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat budget;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat tomatometer;\n\n@end\n```\n\n*Sorting* the array of movies requires a *sort condition* that takes two movies and returns a boolean that represents the relationship between them. So, for sorting all the British Secret Service agent movies by budget:\n\n```objc\nBOOL(^byBudget)(Movie *, Movie *) = ^BOOL(Movie *a, Movie *b) {\n    return a.budget > b.budget;\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *moviesByBudget = [movies sort:byBudget];\n```\n\nSimple.\n\nFor *filtering*, the method requires a movie and returns *true* when the movie matches the condition and *false* otherwise. Below, a simple way to create an immutable array containing the Sean Connery movies.\n\n```objc\nBOOL(^isConnery)(Movie *) = ^BOOL(Movie *a) {\n    return [a.actor isEqual:@\"Sean Connery\"];\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *conneryMovies = [movies filter:isConnery];\n```\n\nBut here is the tricky part. To filter movies played by other actors, more blocks like the one above would be required. The *functional* way to address this is using curried functions‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpopular technique in Swift (and in other Functional Programming languages).\n\nSince *filter* expects a block that takes a movie and returns a boolean, another function is required, where its output is a function matching this signature.\n\nThe new function takes a string (actor‚Äôs name) and returns a function that takes a movie and returns a boolean.\n\n```objc\ntypedef BOOL(^FuncMovieToBool)(Movie *);\n\nFuncMovieToBool(^isActor)(NSString *) = ^FuncMovieToBool(NSString *actor) {\n    return ^BOOL(Movie *movie) {\n        return [movie.actor isEqual:actor];\n    };\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *actorMovies = [movies filter:isActor(@\"Daniel Craig\")];\n```\n\nWithout any changes to the *filter* method signature or implementation, it‚Äôs possible to filter the array of movies to get a list of movies played by any actor on the big screen.\n\nFinally, it‚Äôs possible to combine all these functions to achieve the desired result. Let‚Äôs say I want the movies were Pierce Brosnan played James Bond, *sorted* by ratings and *reduced* to a list.\n\n```objc\nNSArray<Movie *> *moviesByRatings\n    = [[movies filter:isActor(@\"Pierce Brosnan\")]sort:byRatings];\n\nNSString *description\n    = [moviesByRatings reduce:@\"Brosnan movies sorted by ratings:\"\n                   andCombine:^NSString *(NSString *initial, Movie *movie) {\n        return [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%@\\n* %@ (Tomatometer: %@)\",\n                                          initial,\n                                          movie.title,\n                                          @(movie.tomatometer)];\n    }];\n```\n\nVoil√†:\n\n```\nBrosnan movies sorted by ratings:\n* GoldenEye (Tomatometer: 82)\n* Die Another Day (Tomatometer: 57)\n* Tomorrow Never Dies (Tomatometer: 57)\n* The World Is Not Enough (Tomatometer: 51)\n```\n\nBut putting all the fun and excitement aside, would I use these methods on an Objective-C project?
