According to the Apple Store, the estimated delivery date is set for mid-November. I guess I&rsquo;ll just have to wait&hellip;</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten back into listening to podcasts. I never actually took a break, but I used to skip episodes of some shows or completely ignore others. However, this week, I defined/found the lineup of shows that I enjoy and want to continue listening to. I&rsquo;ve also created some <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/\">Overcast</a> playlists to assist me in choosing the next episode to listen to. It&rsquo;s working quite well, and I&rsquo;m pleased with the outcomes. As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;m currently working on a blog post detailing the shows I&rsquo;m following and the setup I&rsquo;ve put in place for my podcast listening.</p>\n<p>I took the <a href=\"https://www.16personalities.com/\">16 Personalities</a> test, which categorizes individuals into one of 16 personality types based on their preferences in five key traits: Extraverted/Introverted, Intuitive/Observant, Thinking/Feeling, Judging/Prospecting, and Assertive/Turbulent This test offers insights into how people perceive the world and make decisions. According to the test, I fall into the <a href=\"https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality\">Architect</a> (INTJ) personality type.</p>\n<p><em>tinyScientist</em> has mastered the art of opening my desk&rsquo;s drawers and operating the desk lamp. At least, he&rsquo;s proficient at both turning it on and back off 🤣</p>\n<h2 id=\"apps\">Apps</h2>\n<p>Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus\">OmniFocus</a>. It&rsquo;s a bit pricey (considering Apple&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205890\">Reminders</a> is free), and it may not be as visually appealing as <a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things</a>, but its power is undeniable. Among all the Task Managers I&rsquo;ve tried, it&rsquo;s the one that requires the least time for curation or browsing whenever I need to tackle a task or have some free time. It simply gets the job done.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been a dedicated <a href=\"https://kapeli.com/dash\">Dash</a> user for a long time, consistently purchasing the latest version each time it&rsquo;s released. The most recent version of Dash introduced a subscription-based pricing model. However, I find this pricing structure to be fair and transparent, costing approximately $15 per year. Dash is the kind of application that I open when I start my computer and rarely close. I started using Dash years ago during a time when I used to disconnect from the internet to code without distractions. Dash became - and still is - my go-to resource whenever I want to access technical documentation. In my city, that&rsquo;s the equivalent of the price of three flat whites (including tips), making it an easy and worthwhile decision.</p>\n<p>I use Safari on my personal devices, and I tried to do the same on my work device, but it was a complete struggle. My daily tasks involve juggling numerous tabs, initiatives, and boards, which can make Safari (and even Firefox or Chrome) feel cumbersome. However, <a href=\"https://arc.net/\">Arc</a> has proven to be a lifesaver in helping me stay focused on what matters most, and the latest update has left me thoroughly impressed. Perhaps I should consider writing a post to share my experience with Arc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hacking\">Hacking</h2>\n<p>Now that Sonoma and iOS 17 have been released, I can finally shift my attention to some of the changes I had in mind for my <a href=\"https://omg.lol\">omg.lol</a> native client. One significant step I&rsquo;ve taken is migrating the entire Core Data implementation, which was used for local data persistence, to the new <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata\">SwiftData</a> stack introduced by Apple during this year&rsquo;s WWDC.</p>\n<p>While SwiftData may not have the same extensive track record as Core Data, which has been around for many years, it feels much more in sync with Swift&rsquo;s nature, considering it&rsquo;s purpose-built for seamless integration with Swift. Moreover, it excels when it comes to working with Swift Packages, outperforming Core Data in this regard.</p>\n<p>The next step is migrating from the <code>ObservableObject</code> protocol to the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Observation/Observable()\">Observable macro</a>, which was also introduced by Apple during this year&rsquo;s WWDC.</p>\n<h2 id=\"work\">Work</h2>\n<p>As they say, business as usual.

My mistake was waiting for the in-store launch to see and hold the device in my hands before placing an order, and it seems that the demand for this particular model is unprecedented. According to the Apple Store, the estimated delivery date is set for mid-November. I guess I'll just have to wait...\n\nI've gotten back into listening to podcasts. I never actually took a break, but I used to skip episodes of some shows or completely ignore others. However, this week, I defined/found the lineup of shows that I enjoy and want to continue listening to. I've also created some [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) playlists to assist me in choosing the next episode to listen to. It's working quite well, and I'm pleased with the outcomes. As a matter of fact, I'm currently working on a blog post detailing the shows I'm following and the setup I've put in place for my podcast listening.\n\nI took the [16 Personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/) test, which categorizes individuals into one of 16 personality types based on their preferences in five key traits: Extraverted/Introverted, Intuitive/Observant, Thinking/Feeling, Judging/Prospecting, and Assertive/Turbulent This test offers insights into how people perceive the world and make decisions. According to the test, I fall into the [Architect](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) (INTJ) personality type.\n\n*tinyScientist* has mastered the art of opening my desk's drawers and operating the desk lamp. At least, he's proficient at both turning it on and back off 🤣\n\n## Apps\n\nSubscribed to [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus). It's a bit pricey (considering Apple's [Reminders](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205890) is free), and it may not be as visually appealing as [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/), but its power is undeniable. Among all the Task Managers I've tried, it's the one that requires the least time for curation or browsing whenever I need to tackle a task or have some free time. It simply gets the job done.\n\nI've been a dedicated [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) user for a long time, consistently purchasing the latest version each time it's released. The most recent version of Dash introduced a subscription-based pricing model. However, I find this pricing structure to be fair and transparent, costing approximately $15 per year. Dash is the kind of application that I open when I start my computer and rarely close. I started using Dash years ago during a time when I used to disconnect from the internet to code without distractions. Dash became - and still is - my go-to resource whenever I want to access technical documentation. In my city, that's the equivalent of the price of three flat whites (including tips), making it an easy and worthwhile decision.\n\nI use Safari on my personal devices, and I tried to do the same on my work device, but it was a complete struggle. My daily tasks involve juggling numerous tabs, initiatives, and boards, which can make Safari (and even Firefox or Chrome) feel cumbersome. However, [Arc](https://arc.net/) has proven to be a lifesaver in helping me stay focused on what matters most, and the latest update has left me thoroughly impressed. Perhaps I should consider writing a post to share my experience with Arc.\n\n## Hacking\n\nNow that Sonoma and iOS 17 have been released, I can finally shift my attention to some of the changes I had in mind for my [omg.lol](https://omg.lol) native client. One significant step I've taken is migrating the entire Core Data implementation, which was used for local data persistence, to the new [SwiftData](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata) stack introduced by Apple during this year's WWDC.\n\nWhile SwiftData may not have the same extensive track record as Core Data, which has been around for many years, it feels much more in sync with Swift's nature, considering it's purpose-built for seamless integration with Swift. Moreover, it excels when it comes to working with Swift Packages, outperforming Core Data in this regard.\n\nThe next step is migrating from the `ObservableObject` protocol to the [Observable macro](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Observation/Observable()), which was also introduced by Apple during this year's WWDC.\n\n## Work\n\nAs they say, business as usual. I worked from the office on Monday and then took Thursday and Friday off to spend time with *tinyScientist* and *scientist*. It's just unfortunate that the weather didn't cooperate.\n",

Implementing this feature was a lot of fun, and I'm thrilled with the results. In fact, both of the lengthy posts I published this week were composed and edited (a couple of times) using the plug-in:\n\n- [Micro.publish 2.0.0](https://otavio.cc/2023/09/13/micropublish.html)\n- [The day I emailed Tim Cook](https://otavio.cc/2023/09/14/the-day-i.html)\n\nAs they say, “eat your own dog food.”\n\nI also wrapped up the second season of [The Bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_(TV_series)), which is a fantastic TV show. I'm crossing my fingers for another season!\n\nAdditionally, I finished watching the second season of [The Afterparty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Afterparty_(TV_series)) without any idea who the killer would turn out to be.\n\nAnd I'm all caught up with [Only Murders in the Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Murders_in_the_Building), yet another killer — pun intended — TV show.\n\nOn the digital front, I decided to delete my [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social/), [Lemmy](https://lemmy.world/), and [Kbin](https://kbin.social/) accounts. Since I never really used these accounts, it made sense to bid them farewell.\n\nLastly, there's some exciting news on the personal front: **tinyScientist sprouted another tooth**! The milestones just keep coming!\n",

The good thing is that all restaurants in the hotel are open 24/7, so having a late lunch is not a problem.</p>\n<p>I found time to do some more work on my <a href=\"https://omg.lol/\">omg.lol</a> client.

My bag was already packed from the day before, but I had to take everything out and repack it to make room for the tea set I bought.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I traveled with a single backpack (a big one, the limit for taking on the cabin), but after putting the tea set in it, it weighed about 10 kg.

It was almost like teleportation finally existed. The workation was spectacular, something I’ve never done before, but it’s good to be back home.

Since almost everyone was partying on the night before, I was the only one on the beach in the morning.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/5dff03b165.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/92d086db4b.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\nOnce I was done taking pictures, I sat in a chair, listening to the Mediterranean Sea (and some birds). Priceless. I can’t remember when was the last time I did something like this. Good thing my AirPods Pro had no juice.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/6d7d2a556b.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/8ec7918886.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/68331e30ac.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/e09f01a88b.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\nAnother good reason to wake up early: breakfast before everyone else. I didn’t make healthier choices and ate scrambled eggs, egg with vegetables and boiled potatoes.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/b67f1e0877.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\nI spent the rest of the morning socializing with teammates until lunch, which I skipped. The good thing is that all restaurants in the hotel are open 24/7, so having a late lunch is not a problem.\n\nI found time to do some more work on my [omg.lol](https://omg.lol/) client. Implemented the `WebpagePersistenceService` and the `WebpageRepository`. The first responsible for storing the webpage (and history of changes) on Core Data, and the latter the abstraction on top of the network and persistence services. The glue.\n\nFound a Starbucks inside the resort, next to one of the pools. Since this is an all-inclusive resort, Starbucks is also included. Perfect for cold drinks next to the beach or a pool.\n\nAt 4pm, we had our Q1 OKRs meeting with the entire company, followed by dinner and the OKR party. The OKR meeting was the only work part of the workation.\n\nBut before the party, I finished the Webpage Feature implementation and can now update [otavio.lol](https://otavio.lol/) using it.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/410ccc312d.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" />\n\n### Saturday\n\nI intended to take more pictures of the sun rising, but I overslept and woke up at 6:30. At that time, the sun was already out there, so I went straight to breakfast. Omelet, bread, and cheese.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/c239d54f9f.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\nAnd then headed out to my favorite spot in the whole resort.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/f7340eedad.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\nImplemented the SwiftUI previews for the Webpage UI and then joined some folks from my team by one of the pools, drinking an Iced Coffee Americano from the hotel’s Starbucks.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/089c5bbe42.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"\" />\n\nI felt guilt for my food choices and decided to eat better during lunch.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/5d0a68a37c.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\nAfter lunch, I must have coffee, so I did. After grabbing another Starbucks, I took the opportunity to walk the resort a bit and found this cat – one of many cats that live in the hotel – staring at me.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/fda2ac0e92.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"\" />\n\nI spent the rest of the day with my team, chatting and having dinner and some [baklavas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava).\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/39ed0ea3fa.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\nWhen the party started, I went to my room to talk to scientist and *tinyScientist*, pack my bag, and sleep.\n\n### Sunday\n\nHomecoming day. I woke up early again, and had a nice walk on the beach, followed by a long, unhealthy breakfast. Our bus was scheduled to leave for the airport at lunchtime, so I might have eaten more than needed to make up for the lunch I was about to miss.\n\nSpent the morning with the folks from the team and left the resort to visit some shops and buy souvenirs and Turkish tea to take back home. My bag was already packed from the day before, but I had to take everything out and repack it to make room for the tea set I bought.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/9addcebd3d.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\nI traveled with a single backpack (a big one, the limit for taking on the cabin), but after putting the tea set in it, it weighed about 10 kg. The limit is 8 kg, and I was afraid someone would weight it at the airport, but no one did, so it was fine.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/02e47b3c91.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"\" />\n\nI was so exhausted I didn’t feel the trip home. It was almost like teleportation finally existed. The workation was spectacular, something I’ve never done before, but it’s good to be back home. I missed scientist and *tinyScientist*, and seeing them again was a relief. The day ended with us giving *tinyScientist* a bath.\n",

The editor was rebuilt from scratch, adding features users were asking for a long time. One of my favorite features is <em>backlinks</em>, something all <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> users know well. Currently Bear supports <code>[[WikiLinks]]</code>, allowing one to link another note (as Obsidian does), but the new version implements <em>backlinks</em>, showing which pages link the one selected. It also shows pages that mention the page but don&rsquo;t link them (<em>Unlinked Mention</em>). This is big! I exported all my <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten\">Zettelkasten</a> notes from Obsidian and imported on Bear and will use it for now on.

There’s a lot to process.\n\nOn Friday I had another day off, still taking 2022 vacation days before the end of March (German regulations, vacation days from a given year have to be spent before end of March of the following year). I took *tinyScientist* to a coffee shop around 9am, where *we* had coffee with a friend and talked about iOS and macOS development, leadership and management, and layoffs. *tinyScientist* got bored with all the talk and decided to take a nap in his *kinderwagen*.\n\nIn the previous weeks I finished two features of my [omg.lol](https://omg.lol) native client: *Statuslog* and *PURLs*, and during this week I started working on the **Now Page**. I still don’t know how I’m gonna distribute the app, if via AppStore, or directly for download as NetNewWire and Micro.blog do. Same goes for pricing, I still haven’t decided if it’ll be a paid app or not.\n\nFinally, the most important thing which happened during the week: *tinyScientist* **had his first *solid* meal**. We were not expecting him to eat (we thought he would only play with the food), but he loved pumpkin. As result, he had pumpkin four days in a row for lunch.\n",

				"content_html": "<p><strong>Braille Institute</strong> released a font for low vision readers, <a href=\"https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont\">Atkinson Hyperlegible</a>. The font is great and I asked <a href=\"https://web.getmatter.com/list/queue\">Matter</a> to add it to their list of supported fonts. Matter accepted my requested and within a couple of hours they deployed the changes. I’ve update <a href=\"https://otavio.cc/\">my blog</a> to use Atkinson Hyperlegible as well.</p>\n<p>I keep going back-and-forth between Reminders and <a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things</a>. Every time there&rsquo;s a new macOS version I go back to Reminders to see what changed. But the truth is, Things is an amazing app and I decided to go back to it. The best of all, I can synchronize Things on all the computers I use, no matter if they’re using the same Apple ID or not. Reminders use iCloud, so I’m limited to the Apple ID I’m using. The downside is that I had to pay for Things twice.</p>\n<p>Same goes for Safari and Firefox. I’m a big Firefox fan (since it was called Phoenix) and love the <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers\">Multi-Account Containers</a> feature, but Safari is so much faster and has better support for physical keys and Apple Pay so I keep going back to it.</p>\n<p>I read a review about <a href=\"https://readkit.app/\">ReadKit</a> and decided to give it a try. I deleted Reeder from my devices to force myself to use it. The application is actually nice and I’m enjoying it a lot. I like the way it integrates with Pinboard as well, which is a service I use for about 15 years. It supports Smart Folders, a great feature when subscribing to tons of feeds.</p>\n<p>Decided to create a <a href=\"https://otavio.cc/kleingarten/\">mini Digital Garden</a> on Micro.blog. It&rsquo;s not perfect because I have to create all the links between pages manually. But at least all the content is hosted in my blog. I have to check if there&rsquo;s an API to post Pages on Micro.blog directly, and add an option to my <a href=\"https://otavio.cc/micropublish/\">Micro.publish plugin</a> so that people can publish posts and pages from Obsidian. For now, the digital garden has notes about <a href=\"https://otavio.cc/unit-testing\">Unit Testing</a>, <a href=\"https://otavio.cc/open-source\">Open Source</a>, and <a href=\"https://otavio.cc/child-benefits-in-germany\">Child Benefits in Germany</a>.</p>\n<p>I released a minor change to <a href=\"https://otavio.cc/micropublish/\">Micro.publish plugin</a>, including a link to my <a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/otaviocc\">Buy My a Coffee</a> page. I added a link to <a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/otaviocc\">Buy My a Coffee</a> in all my <a href=\"https://otavio.cc/kleingarten/\">mini Digital Garden</a> pages as well.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re cat sitting for friends and I usually go to their house at night, after <em>tinyScientist</em> goes to bed. I&rsquo;m using my time there to work on my <a href=\"https://omg.lol\">omg.lol</a> native client for macOS and iOS. My client is fully modularized and each feature is a micro app on its own. Once all the setup is done, the app should scale pretty well, and adding new omg.lol features should be a breeze. I plan to write about <a href=\"https://otavio.cc/modularization/\">Modularization</a> once the setup is finished.</p>\n<p>I finally started playing <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/fire-emblem-engage-switch/\">Fire Emblem Encore</a>, but already have my eyes on <strong>Metroid Prime Remastered</strong>. I must resist, in two weeks there’s <strong>Octopath Traveler II</strong> and in May, <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</strong>.</p>\n<p>LEGO <a href=\"https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-minifigures-series-24-71037\">Series 24</a> is complete. We went to a LEGO store and they had hundreds of minifigure bags. Spent a good amount of time there, <em>feeling</em> the bags and found the last two.</p>\n<p>And finally, I had to use Twitter to talk to my ISP&rsquo;s support.

				"content_text": "**Braille Institute** released a font for low vision readers, [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont). The font is great and I asked [Matter](https://web.getmatter.com/list/queue) to add it to their list of supported fonts. Matter accepted my requested and within a couple of hours they deployed the changes. I’ve update [my blog](https://otavio.cc/) to use Atkinson Hyperlegible as well.\n\nI keep going back-and-forth between Reminders and [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/). Every time there's a new macOS version I go back to Reminders to see what changed. But the truth is, Things is an amazing app and I decided to go back to it. The best of all, I can synchronize Things on all the computers I use, no matter if they’re using the same Apple ID or not. Reminders use iCloud, so I’m limited to the Apple ID I’m using. The downside is that I had to pay for Things twice.\n\nSame goes for Safari and Firefox. I’m a big Firefox fan (since it was called Phoenix) and love the [Multi-Account Containers](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers) feature, but Safari is so much faster and has better support for physical keys and Apple Pay so I keep going back to it.\n\nI read a review about [ReadKit](https://readkit.app/) and decided to give it a try. I deleted Reeder from my devices to force myself to use it. The application is actually nice and I’m enjoying it a lot. I like the way it integrates with Pinboard as well, which is a service I use for about 15 years. It supports Smart Folders, a great feature when subscribing to tons of feeds.\n\nDecided to create a [mini Digital Garden](https://otavio.cc/kleingarten/) on Micro.blog. It's not perfect because I have to create all the links between pages manually. But at least all the content is hosted in my blog. I have to check if there's an API to post Pages on Micro.blog directly, and add an option to my [Micro.publish plugin](https://otavio.cc/micropublish/) so that people can publish posts and pages from Obsidian. For now, the digital garden has notes about [Unit Testing](https://otavio.cc/unit-testing), [Open Source](https://otavio.cc/open-source), and [Child Benefits in Germany](https://otavio.cc/child-benefits-in-germany).\n\nI released a minor change to [Micro.publish plugin](https://otavio.cc/micropublish/), including a link to my [Buy My a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/otaviocc) page. I added a link to [Buy My a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/otaviocc) in all my [mini Digital Garden](https://otavio.cc/kleingarten/) pages as well.\n\nWe're cat sitting for friends and I usually go to their house at night, after *tinyScientist* goes to bed. I'm using my time there to work on my [omg.lol](https://omg.lol) native client for macOS and iOS. My client is fully modularized and each feature is a micro app on its own. Once all the setup is done, the app should scale pretty well, and adding new omg.lol features should be a breeze. I plan to write about [Modularization](https://otavio.cc/modularization/) once the setup is finished.\n\nI finally started playing [Fire Emblem Encore](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/fire-emblem-engage-switch/), but already have my eyes on **Metroid Prime Remastered**. I must resist, in two weeks there’s **Octopath Traveler II** and in May, **The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom**.\n\nLEGO [Series 24](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-minifigures-series-24-71037) is complete. We went to a LEGO store and they had hundreds of minifigure bags. Spent a good amount of time there, _feeling_ the bags and found the last two.\n\nAnd finally, I had to use Twitter to talk to my ISP's support. Their service is too unstable and every now and then I have to contact them to complain (and ask for my money back). Maybe it's time to switch providers so that I don't have to use Twitter anymore.\n",

Since I have more than one pouch - a small one, and a bigger when I'm carrying my Fuji - I decided to make something to put my pocket notebooks - which I also make -, cards, pocket knife, and flashlight. This way it's easier to move all my EDC from one pouch to another.\n\nLeather work is fun, and for me it works for medidation or to listen to podcasts I need to focus on.\n\nI'm pretty happy with the final result.

For a long time the strategy adopted by engineers in this situation was to rely on Apple&rsquo;s Reachability class, a sample code the company used to provide for download on their developer portal. Well, either that or one of the many CocoaPods frameworks the community built to replace Apple&rsquo;s drag-and-drop solution.

Building this client is helping me to explore and learn new APIs.</p>\n<p>The protocols <code>Publisher</code>, <code>Subscriber</code>, and <code>Subscription</code> are examples of these APIs. To implement a custom publisher it&rsquo;s necessary to implement types conforming to two of these protocols.</p>\n<p>First, a quick recap:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher\"><code>Publisher</code></a> is the type which emits events over time,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber/\"><code>Subscriber</code></a> is the type which receives events published by the publisher, and</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscription\"><code>Subscription</code></a> implements the link between publishers and subscribers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first step was to define my publisher interface. Since the monitor requires a queue to run, I decided to pass the queue as argument. In order to simplify its interface, a background queue is passed by default to the implementation.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#fff;background-color:#1f1f24;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-swift\" data-lang=\"swift\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#fc5fa3\">extension</span> <span style=\"color:#5dd8ff\">NWPathMonitor</span> {\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>  \n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    <span style=\"color:#fc5fa3\">public</span> <span style=\"color:#fc5fa3\">func</span> <span style=\"color:#41a1c0\">pathUpdatePublisher</span>(\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>        on queue: DispatchQueue = .global(qos: .background)\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    ) -&gt; NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher {\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>      <span style=\"color:#6c7986\">// ...</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    }\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>}\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The interface provides a hint of the first type to be implemented, <code>NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher</code>.

				"content_text": "About a month ago I decided to build a new app to attend a personal need, a desktop client for [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in), a service I've been using for over a decade to store and manage my bookmarks.\n\nAs any application which requires internet to fetch and update data, my client needed a way to detect network accessibility. For a long time the strategy adopted by engineers in this situation was to rely on Apple's Reachability class, a sample code the company used to provide for download on their developer portal. Well, either that or one of the many CocoaPods frameworks the community built to replace Apple's drag-and-drop solution. But since iOS 12.0 and macOS 10.14 there's a powerfull first-party alternative.\n\nIntroduced a couple of years ago, [`NWPathMonitor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpathmonitor) is the easiest way to detect network changes (and retrieve connection properties). Its interface is extremely simple to use, providing a callback to get notified of updates.\n\n```swift\nlet monitor = NWPathMonitor()\nlet queue = DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background)\n\nmonitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path in\n    print(path.status) // .unsatisfied, .satisfied, .requiresConnection\n}\n\nmonitor.start(\n    queue: queue\n)\n\n// ...\n\nmonitor.stop()\n```\n\nMy application in built in SwiftUI (2.0) and Combine and the solution above wouldn't *feel right* in my View Model. So I started with a simple wrapper, hiding the monitor and exposing a publisher which notifies path changes. \n\n```swift\nlet wrapper = NWPathMonitorWrapper()\n\nlet cancellable = wrapper\n    .pathUpdatePublisher()\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .sink { path in\n        print(path.status)\n    }\n\nwrapper.start()\n```\n\nBut the implementation (below) still requires `NWPathMonitorWrapper.start()` to be called, hurting the beauty of the publisher-subscriber relationship.\n\n```swift\npublic final class NWPathMonitorWrapper {\n\n    // MARK: - Properties\n\n    private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n    private let queue: DispatchQueue = .global(qos: .background)\n    private let pathUpdateSubject = PassthroughSubject<NWPath, Never>()\n\n    // MARK: - Life cycle\n\n    public init(\n        monitor: NWPathMonitor = NWPathMonitor()\n    ) {\n        self.monitor = monitor\n        self.monitor.pathUpdateHandler = {\n            self.pathUpdateSubject.send($0)\n        }\n    }\n\n    // MARK: - Public\n\n    public func start() {\n        monitor.start(\n            queue: queue\n        )\n    }\n\n    public func stop() {\n        monitor.cancel()\n    }\n\n    public func pathUpdatePublisher() -> AnyPublisher<NWPath, Never> {\n        pathUpdateSubject\n            .eraseToAnyPublisher()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo I looked for a similar example in Apple's frameworks, one which requires a method to be called to trigger the action. Turns out `URLSession`, familiar to every iOS/macOS engineer, is the perfect example since it requires `URLSession.resume()` to be called to fire the network requrest. Recently `URLSession` got a new method, a [publisher](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/3329707-datataskpublisher) which starts the request at the moment there's demand (a subscriber):\n\n```swift\nlet session = URLSession.shared\n\nlet cancellable = session\n    .dataTaskPublisher(for: request)\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .tryMap { result in\n        // ...\n    }\n    .sink(\n        receiveCompletion: { _ in },\n        receiveValue: { _ in }    \n    )\n```\n\nAnd that's the interface I wanted for my monitor. A simple publisher which starts *emitting values* as soon as there's demand.\n\n```swift\nlet monitor = NWPathMonitor()\n\nlet cancellable = monitor\n    .pathUpdatePublisher()\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .sink { path in\n        print(path.status)\n    } \n```\n\nSwiftUI and Combine are new to me, I spiked and re-implemented some UI components I have up in my sleeve, but nothing too complex. Building this client is helping me to explore and learn new APIs.\n\nThe protocols `Publisher`, `Subscriber`, and `Subscription` are examples of these APIs. To implement a custom publisher it's necessary to implement types conforming to two of these protocols.\n\nFirst, a quick recap:\n\n* [`Publisher`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher) is the type which emits events over time,\n* [`Subscriber`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber/) is the type which receives events published by the publisher, and\n* [`Subscription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscription) implements the link between publishers and subscribers.\n\nThe first step was to define my publisher interface. Since the monitor requires a queue to run, I decided to pass the queue as argument. In order to simplify its interface, a background queue is passed by default to the implementation.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n  \n    public func pathUpdatePublisher(\n        on queue: DispatchQueue = .global(qos: .background)\n    ) -> NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher {\n      // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe interface provides a hint of the first type to be implemented, `NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher`. Most of the code is boilerplate, and for this publisher, the `Output` expected is `NWPath`, without a `Failure`.\n\nWhen the publisher *receives* a subscriber, the link between them is established.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n   \n  public struct PathMonitorPublisher: Publisher {\n\n        // MARK: - Nested types\n    \n        public typealias Output = NWPath\n        public typealias Failure = Never\n    \n        // MARK: - Properties\n    \n        private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n        private let queue: DispatchQueue\n    \n        // MARK: - Life cycle\n    \n        fileprivate init(\n            monitor: NWPathMonitor,\n            queue: DispatchQueue\n        ) {\n            self.monitor = monitor\n            self.queue = queue\n        }\n    \n        // MARK: - Public\n    \n        public func receive<S>(\n            subscriber: S\n        ) where S: Subscriber, S.Failure == Failure, S.Input == Output {\n            let subscription = PathMonitorSubscription(\n                subscriber: subscriber,\n                monitor: monitor,\n                queue: queue\n            )\n    \n            subscriber.receive(\n                subscription: subscription\n            )\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `Subscription` fulfills the demand from the subscriber. As soon as there's demand, it starts monitoring changes using the monitor's callback, passing changes to the subscriber. And since `Subscription` conforms to [`Cancellable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/Cancellable), `cancel()` can be used to stop the monitor.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n\n    private final class PathMonitorSubscription<\n        S: Subscriber\n    >: Subscription where S.Input == NWPath {\n\n        // MARK: - Nested types\n  \n        private let subscriber: S\n        private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n        private let queue: DispatchQueue\n  \n        // MARK: - Life cycle\n  \n        init(\n            subscriber: S,\n            monitor: NWPathMonitor,\n            queue: DispatchQueue\n        ) {\n            self.subscriber = subscriber\n            self.monitor = monitor\n            self.queue = queue\n        }\n  \n        // MARK: - Public\n  \n        func request(\n            _ demand: Subscribers.Demand\n        ) {\n            guard\n                demand == .unlimited,\n                monitor.pathUpdateHandler == nil\n            else {\n                return\n            }\n  \n            monitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path in\n                _ = self.subscriber.receive(path)\n            }\n  \n            monitor.start(\n                queue: queue\n            )\n        }\n  \n        func cancel() {\n            monitor.cancel()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith all in place, the View Model becomes extremely simple and elegant. Below a View Model which publishes a boolean indicating the connectivity status to the View.\n\n```swift\nfinal class ViewModel: ObservableObject {\n\n    // MARK: - Properties\n\n    @Published var isConnected: Bool = false\n    private var monitorCancellable: Cancellable?\n\n    // MARK: - Life cycle\n\n    init(\n        pathMonitorPublisher: NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher\n    ) {\n        monitorCancellable = pathMonitorPublisher\n            .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n            .map { $0.status == .satisfied }\n            .assign(to: \\.isConnected, on: self)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOverall, I'm happy with the result, and am looking forward to using Combine (and SwiftUI) in production.\n\nResources:\n\n* [Using Combine](https://heckj.github.io/swiftui-notes/)\n* [Introducing Combine](https://www.apeth.com/UnderstandingCombine/start.html)\n",

The *combine operation* takes the initial state and an object and returns a recombined object which is of the same type of the initial state.\n\nThe `NSArray` category ended up with the following interface:\n\n```objc\ntypedef id(^Transform)(id);\ntypedef BOOL(^Condition)(id);\ntypedef BOOL(^SortCondition)(id, id);\ntypedef id(^Combine)(id, id);\n\n[@interface](https://micro.blog/interface) NSArray (MFSR)\n\n- (NSArray *)map:(Transform)transform;\n- (NSArray *)filter:(Condition)condition;\n- (NSArray *)sort:(SortCondition)isOrderedBefore;\n- (id)reduce:(id)initial andCombine:(Combine)combine;\n\n@end\n```\n\nTo test the interface above and its implementation, I started with a immutable array of movies — James Bond movies — loaded from a *plist* file.\n\n```objc\nNSArray<Movie *> *movies = [[NSBundle mainBundle] moviesFromPlist];\n```\n\nWhere each movie contains a title, the actor’s name who played Bond, and some additional information about about the flick. The movie interface is defined as:\n\n```objc\n@interface Movie : NSObject\n\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSString *title;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSString *actor;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSInteger year;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat boxOffice;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat budget;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat tomatometer;\n\n@end\n```\n\n*Sorting* the array of movies requires a *sort condition* that takes two movies and returns a boolean that represents the relationship between them. So, for sorting all the British Secret Service agent movies by budget:\n\n```objc\nBOOL(^byBudget)(Movie *, Movie *) = ^BOOL(Movie *a, Movie *b) {\n    return a.budget > b.budget;\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *moviesByBudget = [movies sort:byBudget];\n```\n\nSimple.\n\nFor *filtering*, the method requires a movie and returns *true* when the movie matches the condition and *false* otherwise. Below, a simple way to create an immutable array containing the Sean Connery movies.\n\n```objc\nBOOL(^isConnery)(Movie *) = ^BOOL(Movie *a) {\n    return [a.actor isEqual:@\"Sean Connery\"];\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *conneryMovies = [movies filter:isConnery];\n```\n\nBut here is the tricky part. To filter movies played by other actors, more blocks like the one above would be required. The *functional* way to address this is using curried functions — popular technique in Swift (and in other Functional Programming languages).\n\nSince *filter* expects a block that takes a movie and returns a boolean, another function is required, where its output is a function matching this signature.\n\nThe new function takes a string (actor’s name) and returns a function that takes a movie and returns a boolean.\n\n```objc\ntypedef BOOL(^FuncMovieToBool)(Movie *);\n\nFuncMovieToBool(^isActor)(NSString *) = ^FuncMovieToBool(NSString *actor) {\n    return ^BOOL(Movie *movie) {\n        return [movie.actor isEqual:actor];\n    };\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *actorMovies = [movies filter:isActor(@\"Daniel Craig\")];\n```\n\nWithout any changes to the *filter* method signature or implementation, it’s possible to filter the array of movies to get a list of movies played by any actor on the big screen.\n\nFinally, it’s possible to combine all these functions to achieve the desired result. Let’s say I want the movies were Pierce Brosnan played James Bond, *sorted* by ratings and *reduced* to a list.\n\n```objc\nNSArray<Movie *> *moviesByRatings\n    = [[movies filter:isActor(@\"Pierce Brosnan\")]sort:byRatings];\n\nNSString *description\n    = [moviesByRatings reduce:@\"Brosnan movies sorted by ratings:\"\n                   andCombine:^NSString *(NSString *initial, Movie *movie) {\n        return [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%@\\n* %@ (Tomatometer: %@)\",\n                                          initial,\n                                          movie.title,\n                                          @(movie.tomatometer)];\n    }];\n```\n\nVoilà:\n\n```\nBrosnan movies sorted by ratings:\n* GoldenEye (Tomatometer: 82)\n* Die Another Day (Tomatometer: 57)\n* Tomorrow Never Dies (Tomatometer: 57)\n* The World Is Not Enough (Tomatometer: 51)\n```\n\nBut putting all the fun and excitement aside, would I use these methods on an Objective-C project? Probably not — `NSArray` already implements methods for sorting and filtering arrays using `NSPredicate`.\n\nMy point here was to experiment and practice *map*, *filter*, *sort*, *reduce*, and *curried functions*. Programming requires practice. And practicing these techniques and methods (and reimplementing them) in Objective-C improved the way I use them in Swift.\n",
