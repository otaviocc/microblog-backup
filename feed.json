The editor was rebuilt from scratch, adding features users were asking for a long time. One of my favorite features is <em>backlinks</em>, something all <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> users know well. Currently Bear supports <code>[[WikiLinks]]</code>, allowing one to link another note (as Obsidian does), but the new version implements <em>backlinks</em>, showing which pages link the one selected. It also shows pages that mention the page but don&rsquo;t link them (<em>Unlinked Mention</em>). This is big! I exported all my <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten\">Zettelkasten</a> notes from Obsidian and imported on Bear and will use it for now on.

It’s not a browser but a <em>bookmark</em> manager. It gives access to Spaces, Easel, and Notes one has on their computer. And offers the ability to create new tabs by importing URLs from other apps via the iOS’ share sheet. Still not sure how useful it is; time will tell.</p>\n<h2 id=\"work\">Work</h2>\n<p>Most of the time I work from home, but if there&rsquo;s a day I like to go to the office, this day is Monday.

It was great, full house, and we had too speakers from Nord Security. Bob from <a href=\"https://nordlocker.com/\">NordLocker</a> talked about SwiftUI and Ieva from <a href=\"https://nordvpn.com/\">NordVPN</a> about <a href=\"https://fastlane.tools/\">fastlane</a>, screenshot automation and the iOS strategy to inject mock data for App Store screenshots.</p>\n<p>Speaking of work, on Thursday I had a long training on Leadership (and Management) at the company. Earlier this year I got a new title/role, going from <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> to <strong>Engineering Team Lead</strong>, which means I’m half of the time Software Engineer and the other half Engineering Manager. It’s a brand new world to me, so I went back home exhausted.

Bob from [NordLocker](https://nordlocker.com/) talked about SwiftUI and Ieva from [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/) about [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/), screenshot automation and the iOS strategy to inject mock data for App Store screenshots.\n\nSpeaking of work, on Thursday I had a long training on Leadership (and Management) at the company. Earlier this year I got a new title/role, going from **Senior Software Engineer** to **Engineering Team Lead**, which means I’m half of the time Software Engineer and the other half Engineering Manager.

				"content_html": "<p><strong>Braille Institute</strong> released a font for low vision readers, <a href=\"https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont\">Atkinson Hyperlegible</a>. The font is great and I asked <a href=\"https://web.getmatter.com/list/queue\">Matter</a> to add it to their list of supported fonts. Matter accepted my requested and within a couple of hours they deployed the changes. I’ve update <a href=\"https://otavio.cc/\">my blog</a> to use Atkinson Hyperlegible as well.</p>\n<p>I keep going back-and-forth between Reminders and <a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things</a>. Every time there&rsquo;s a new macOS version I go back to Reminders to see what changed. But the truth is, Things is an amazing app and I decided to go back to it. The best of all, I can synchronize Things on all the computers I use, no matter if they’re using the same Apple ID or not. Reminders use iCloud, so I’m limited to the Apple ID I’m using. The downside is that I had to pay for Things twice.</p>\n<p>Same goes for Safari and Firefox. I’m a big Firefox fan (since it was called Phoenix) and love the <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers\">Multi-Account Containers</a> feature, but Safari is so much faster and has better support for physical keys and Apple Pay so I keep going back to it.</p>\n<p>I read a review about <a href=\"https://readkit.app/\">ReadKit</a> and decided to give it a try. I deleted Reeder from my devices to force myself to use it. The application is actually nice and I’m enjoying it a lot. I like the way it integrates with Pinboard as well, which is a service I use for about 15 years.

				"content_text": "**Braille Institute** released a font for low vision readers, [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont). The font is great and I asked [Matter](https://web.getmatter.com/list/queue) to add it to their list of supported fonts. Matter accepted my requested and within a couple of hours they deployed the changes. I’ve update [my blog](https://otavio.cc/) to use Atkinson Hyperlegible as well.\n\nI keep going back-and-forth between Reminders and [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/). Every time there's a new macOS version I go back to Reminders to see what changed. But the truth is, Things is an amazing app and I decided to go back to it. The best of all, I can synchronize Things on all the computers I use, no matter if they’re using the same Apple ID or not. Reminders use iCloud, so I’m limited to the Apple ID I’m using. The downside is that I had to pay for Things twice.\n\nSame goes for Safari and Firefox. I’m a big Firefox fan (since it was called Phoenix) and love the [Multi-Account Containers](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers) feature, but Safari is so much faster and has better support for physical keys and Apple Pay so I keep going back to it.\n\nI read a review about [ReadKit](https://readkit.app/) and decided to give it a try. I deleted Reeder from my devices to force myself to use it. The application is actually nice and I’m enjoying it a lot. I like the way it integrates with Pinboard as well, which is a service I use for about 15 years. It supports Smart Folders, a great feature when subscribing to tons of feeds.\n\nDecided to create a [mini Digital Garden](https://otavio.cc/kleingarten/) on Micro.blog.

For a long time the strategy adopted by engineers in this situation was to rely on Apple&rsquo;s Reachability class, a sample code the company used to provide for download on their developer portal. Well, either that or one of the many CocoaPods frameworks the community built to replace Apple&rsquo;s drag-and-drop solution. But since iOS 12.0 and macOS 10.14 there&rsquo;s a powerfull first-party alternative.</p>\n<p>Introduced a couple of years ago, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpathmonitor\"><code>NWPathMonitor</code></a> is the easiest way to detect network changes (and retrieve connection properties). Its interface is extremely simple to use, providing a callback to get notified of updates.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-swift\" data-lang=\"swift\"><span style=\"color:#a90d91\">let</span> <span style=\"color:#000\">monitor</span> = <span style=\"color:#000\">NWPathMonitor</span>()\n<span style=\"color:#a90d91\">let</span> <span style=\"color:#000\">queue</span> = <span style=\"color:#000\">DispatchQueue</span>.<span style=\"color:#000\">global</span>(<span style=\"color:#000\">qos</span>: .<span style=\"color:#000\">background</span>)\n\n<span style=\"color:#000\">monitor</span>.<span style=\"color:#000\">pathUpdateHandler</span> = { <span style=\"color:#000\">path</span> <span style=\"color:#a90d91\">in</span>\n    <span style=\"color:#5b269a\">print</span>(<span style=\"color:#000\">path</span>.<span style=\"color:#000\">status</span>) <span style=\"color:#177500\">// .unsatisfied, .satisfied, .requiresConnection</span>\n}\n\n<span style=\"color:#000\">monitor</span>.<span style=\"color:#000\">start</span>(\n    <span style=\"color:#000\">queue</span>: <span style=\"color:#000\">queue</span>\n)\n\n<span style=\"color:#177500\">// ...</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:#000\">monitor</span>.<span style=\"color:#000\">stop</span>()\n</code></pre></div><p>My application in built in SwiftUI (2.0) and Combine and the solution above wouldn&rsquo;t <em>feel right</em> in my View Model.

Turns out <code>URLSession</code>, familiar to every iOS/macOS engineer, is the perfect example since it requires <code>URLSession.resume()</code> to be called to fire the network requrest. Recently <code>URLSession</code> got a new method, a <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/3329707-datataskpublisher\">publisher</a> which starts the request at the moment there&rsquo;s demand (a subscriber):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-swift\" data-lang=\"swift\"><span style=\"color:#a90d91\">let</span> <span style=\"color:#000\">session</span> = <span style=\"color:#000\">URLSession</span>.<span style=\"color:#000\">shared</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:#a90d91\">let</span> <span style=\"color:#000\">cancellable</span> = <span style=\"color:#000\">session</span>\n    .<span style=\"color:#000\">dataTaskPublisher</span>(<span style=\"color:#a90d91\">for</span>: <span style=\"color:#000\">request</span>)\n    .<span style=\"color:#000\">receive</span>(<span style=\"color:#000\">on</span>: <span style=\"color:#000\">RunLoop</span>.<span style=\"color:#000\">main</span>)\n    .<span style=\"color:#000\">tryMap</span> { <span style=\"color:#000\">result</span> <span style=\"color:#a90d91\">in</span>\n        <span style=\"color:#177500\">// ...</span>\n    }\n    .<span style=\"color:#000\">sink</span>(\n        <span style=\"color:#000\">receiveCompletion</span>: { <span style=\"color:#a90d91\">_</span> <span style=\"color:#a90d91\">in</span> },\n        <span style=\"color:#000\">receiveValue</span>: { <span style=\"color:#a90d91\">_</span> <span style=\"color:#a90d91\">in</span> }    \n    )\n</code></pre></div><p>And that&rsquo;s the interface I wanted for my monitor. A simple publisher which starts <em>emitting values</em> as soon as there&rsquo;s demand.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-swift\" data-lang=\"swift\"><span style=\"color:#a90d91\">let</span> <span style=\"color:#000\">monitor</span> = <span style=\"color:#000\">NWPathMonitor</span>()\n\n<span style=\"color:#a90d91\">let</span> <span style=\"color:#000\">cancellable</span> = <span style=\"color:#000\">monitor</span>\n    .<span style=\"color:#000\">pathUpdatePublisher</span>()\n    .<span style=\"color:#000\">receive</span>(<span style=\"color:#000\">on</span>: <span style=\"color:#000\">RunLoop</span>.<span style=\"color:#000\">main</span>)\n    .<span style=\"color:#000\">sink</span> { <span style=\"color:#000\">path</span> <span style=\"color:#a90d91\">in</span>\n        <span style=\"color:#5b269a\">print</span>(<span style=\"color:#000\">path</span>.<span style=\"color:#000\">status</span>)\n    } \n</code></pre></div><p>SwiftUI and Combine are new to me, I spiked and re-implemented some UI components I have up in my sleeve, but nothing too complex. Building this client is helping me to explore and learn new APIs.</p>\n<p>The protocols <code>Publisher</code>, <code>Subscriber</code>, and <code>Subscription</code> are examples of these APIs.

				"content_text": "About a month ago I decided to build a new app to attend a personal need, a desktop client for [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in), a service I've been using for over a decade to store and manage my bookmarks.\n\nAs any application which requires internet to fetch and update data, my client needed a way to detect network accessibility. For a long time the strategy adopted by engineers in this situation was to rely on Apple's Reachability class, a sample code the company used to provide for download on their developer portal. Well, either that or one of the many CocoaPods frameworks the community built to replace Apple's drag-and-drop solution. But since iOS 12.0 and macOS 10.14 there's a powerfull first-party alternative.\n\nIntroduced a couple of years ago, [`NWPathMonitor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpathmonitor) is the easiest way to detect network changes (and retrieve connection properties). Its interface is extremely simple to use, providing a callback to get notified of updates.\n\n```swift\nlet monitor = NWPathMonitor()\nlet queue = DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background)\n\nmonitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path in\n    print(path.status) // .unsatisfied, .satisfied, .requiresConnection\n}\n\nmonitor.start(\n    queue: queue\n)\n\n// ...\n\nmonitor.stop()\n```\n\nMy application in built in SwiftUI (2.0) and Combine and the solution above wouldn't *feel right* in my View Model. So I started with a simple wrapper, hiding the monitor and exposing a publisher which notifies path changes. \n\n```swift\nlet wrapper = NWPathMonitorWrapper()\n\nlet cancellable = wrapper\n    .pathUpdatePublisher()\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .sink { path in\n        print(path.status)\n    }\n\nwrapper.start()\n```\n\nBut the implementation (below) still requires `NWPathMonitorWrapper.start()` to be called, hurting the beauty of the publisher-subscriber relationship.\n\n```swift\npublic final class NWPathMonitorWrapper {\n\n    // MARK: - Properties\n\n    private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n    private let queue: DispatchQueue = .global(qos: .background)\n    private let pathUpdateSubject = PassthroughSubject<NWPath, Never>()\n\n    // MARK: - Life cycle\n\n    public init(\n        monitor: NWPathMonitor = NWPathMonitor()\n    ) {\n        self.monitor = monitor\n        self.monitor.pathUpdateHandler = {\n            self.pathUpdateSubject.send($0)\n        }\n    }\n\n    // MARK: - Public\n\n    public func start() {\n        monitor.start(\n            queue: queue\n        )\n    }\n\n    public func stop() {\n        monitor.cancel()\n    }\n\n    public func pathUpdatePublisher() -> AnyPublisher<NWPath, Never> {\n        pathUpdateSubject\n            .eraseToAnyPublisher()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo I looked for a similar example in Apple's frameworks, one which requires a method to be called to trigger the action. Turns out `URLSession`, familiar to every iOS/macOS engineer, is the perfect example since it requires `URLSession.resume()` to be called to fire the network requrest. Recently `URLSession` got a new method, a [publisher](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/3329707-datataskpublisher) which starts the request at the moment there's demand (a subscriber):\n\n```swift\nlet session = URLSession.shared\n\nlet cancellable = session\n    .dataTaskPublisher(for: request)\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .tryMap { result in\n        // ...\n    }\n    .sink(\n        receiveCompletion: { _ in },\n        receiveValue: { _ in }    \n    )\n```\n\nAnd that's the interface I wanted for my monitor. A simple publisher which starts *emitting values* as soon as there's demand.\n\n```swift\nlet monitor = NWPathMonitor()\n\nlet cancellable = monitor\n    .pathUpdatePublisher()\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .sink { path in\n        print(path.status)\n    } \n```\n\nSwiftUI and Combine are new to me, I spiked and re-implemented some UI components I have up in my sleeve, but nothing too complex. Building this client is helping me to explore and learn new APIs.\n\nThe protocols `Publisher`, `Subscriber`, and `Subscription` are examples of these APIs. To implement a custom publisher it's necessary to implement types conforming to two of these protocols.\n\nFirst, a quick recap:\n\n* [`Publisher`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher) is the type which emits events over time,\n* [`Subscriber`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber/) is the type which receives events published by the publisher, and\n* [`Subscription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscription) implements the link between publishers and subscribers.\n\nThe first step was to define my publisher interface. Since the monitor requires a queue to run, I decided to pass the queue as argument. In order to simplify its interface, a background queue is passed by default to the implementation.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n  \n    public func pathUpdatePublisher(\n        on queue: DispatchQueue = .global(qos: .background)\n    ) -> NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher {\n      // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe interface provides a hint of the first type to be implemented, `NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher`. Most of the code is boilerplate, and for this publisher, the `Output` expected is `NWPath`, without a `Failure`.\n\nWhen the publisher *receives* a subscriber, the link between them is established.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n   \n  public struct PathMonitorPublisher: Publisher {\n\n        // MARK: - Nested types\n    \n        public typealias Output = NWPath\n        public typealias Failure = Never\n    \n        // MARK: - Properties\n    \n        private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n        private let queue: DispatchQueue\n    \n        // MARK: - Life cycle\n    \n        fileprivate init(\n            monitor: NWPathMonitor,\n            queue: DispatchQueue\n        ) {\n            self.monitor = monitor\n            self.queue = queue\n        }\n    \n        // MARK: - Public\n    \n        public func receive<S>(\n            subscriber: S\n        ) where S: Subscriber, S.Failure == Failure, S.Input == Output {\n            let subscription = PathMonitorSubscription(\n                subscriber: subscriber,\n                monitor: monitor,\n                queue: queue\n            )\n    \n            subscriber.receive(\n                subscription: subscription\n            )\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `Subscription` fulfills the demand from the subscriber. As soon as there's demand, it starts monitoring changes using the monitor's callback, passing changes to the subscriber. And since `Subscription` conforms to [`Cancellable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/Cancellable), `cancel()` can be used to stop the monitor.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n\n    private final class PathMonitorSubscription<\n        S: Subscriber\n    >: Subscription where S.Input == NWPath {\n\n        // MARK: - Nested types\n  \n        private let subscriber: S\n        private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n        private let queue: DispatchQueue\n  \n        // MARK: - Life cycle\n  \n        init(\n            subscriber: S,\n            monitor: NWPathMonitor,\n            queue: DispatchQueue\n        ) {\n            self.subscriber = subscriber\n            self.monitor = monitor\n            self.queue = queue\n        }\n  \n        // MARK: - Public\n  \n        func request(\n            _ demand: Subscribers.Demand\n        ) {\n            guard\n                demand == .unlimited,\n                monitor.pathUpdateHandler == nil\n            else {\n                return\n            }\n  \n            monitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path in\n                _ = self.subscriber.receive(path)\n            }\n  \n            monitor.start(\n                queue: queue\n            )\n        }\n  \n        func cancel() {\n            monitor.cancel()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith all in place, the View Model becomes extremely simple and elegant. Below a View Model which publishes a boolean indicating the connectivity status to the View.\n\n```swift\nfinal class ViewModel: ObservableObject {\n\n    // MARK: - Properties\n\n    @Published var isConnected: Bool = false\n    private var monitorCancellable: Cancellable?\n\n    // MARK: - Life cycle\n\n    init(\n        pathMonitorPublisher: NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher\n    ) {\n        monitorCancellable = pathMonitorPublisher\n            .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n            .map { $0.status == .satisfied }\n            .assign(to: \\.isConnected, on: self)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOverall, I'm happy with the result, and am looking forward to using Combine (and SwiftUI) in production.\n\nResources:\n\n* [Using Combine](https://heckj.github.io/swiftui-notes/)\n* [Introducing Combine](https://www.apeth.com/UnderstandingCombine/start.html)\n",

				"content_text": "I strongly believe that the best way to learn something new is by experimenting and practicing it.\n\nA few months ago I was studying *Functional Programming in Swift*. Swift is a modern, powerful, and safe language. Its syntax is so simple and elegante that it works as an invitation to dive into the Functional Programming world.\n\nAfter practicing Functional Programming in Swift for a few weeks, I decided to try something a little bit different. I decided it was time to experiment with *curried functions*, *map*, *filter*, *sort*, and *reduce* in Objective-C.\n\nSwift collections implement *map*, *sort*, *filter*, and *reduce*, so the first step on my experiment was to reimplement these in a `NSArray` category, trying to match the method signature that Swift implements.\n\n* **Map**: given a *transform operation*, it returns a new `NSArray` where all its elements are transformed according to the operation. The *transform operation* takes an object and returns another object (that might be of a different type of the original object).\n* **Filter**: given a *condition operation*, it returns a new `NSArray` where all its elements satisfy the condition. The *condition operation* takes an object and returns a boolean.\n* **Sort**: given a *sort condition*, it returns a new `NSArray` where all its elements are sorted according to the condition. The *sort condition* takes two objects and returns a boolean.\n* **Reduce**: given a *combine operation*, it returns a recombined object by recursively processing its constituent parts. The *combine operation* takes the initial state and an object and returns a recombined object which is of the same type of the initial state.\n\nThe `NSArray` category ended up with the following interface:\n\n```objc\ntypedef id(^Transform)(id);\ntypedef BOOL(^Condition)(id);\ntypedef BOOL(^SortCondition)(id, id);\ntypedef id(^Combine)(id, id);\n\n[@interface](https://micro.blog/interface) NSArray (MFSR)\n\n- (NSArray *)map:(Transform)transform;\n- (NSArray *)filter:(Condition)condition;\n- (NSArray *)sort:(SortCondition)isOrderedBefore;\n- (id)reduce:(id)initial andCombine:(Combine)combine;\n\n@end\n```\n\nTo test the interface above and its implementation, I started with a immutable array of movies — James Bond movies — loaded from a *plist* file.\n\n```objc\nNSArray<Movie *> *movies = [[NSBundle mainBundle] moviesFromPlist];\n```\n\nWhere each movie contains a title, the actor’s name who played Bond, and some additional information about about the flick. The movie interface is defined as:\n\n```objc\n@interface Movie : NSObject\n\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSString *title;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSString *actor;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSInteger year;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat boxOffice;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat budget;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat tomatometer;\n\n@end\n```\n\n*Sorting* the array of movies requires a *sort condition* that takes two movies and returns a boolean that represents the relationship between them. So, for sorting all the British Secret Service agent movies by budget:\n\n```objc\nBOOL(^byBudget)(Movie *, Movie *) = ^BOOL(Movie *a, Movie *b) {\n    return a.budget > b.budget;\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *moviesByBudget = [movies sort:byBudget];\n```\n\nSimple.\n\nFor *filtering*, the method requires a movie and returns *true* when the movie matches the condition and *false* otherwise. Below, a simple way to create an immutable array containing the Sean Connery movies.\n\n```objc\nBOOL(^isConnery)(Movie *) = ^BOOL(Movie *a) {\n    return [a.actor isEqual:@\"Sean Connery\"];\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *conneryMovies = [movies filter:isConnery];\n```\n\nBut here is the tricky part. To filter movies played by other actors, more blocks like the one above would be required. The *functional* way to address this is using curried functions — popular technique in Swift (and in other Functional Programming languages).\n\nSince *filter* expects a block that takes a movie and returns a boolean, another function is required, where its output is a function matching this signature.\n\nThe new function takes a string (actor’s name) and returns a function that takes a movie and returns a boolean.\n\n```objc\ntypedef BOOL(^FuncMovieToBool)(Movie *);\n\nFuncMovieToBool(^isActor)(NSString *) = ^FuncMovieToBool(NSString *actor) {\n    return ^BOOL(Movie *movie) {\n        return [movie.actor isEqual:actor];\n    };\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *actorMovies = [movies filter:isActor(@\"Daniel Craig\")];\n```\n\nWithout any changes to the *filter* method signature or implementation, it’s possible to filter the array of movies to get a list of movies played by any actor on the big screen.\n\nFinally, it’s possible to combine all these functions to achieve the desired result. Let’s say I want the movies were Pierce Brosnan played James Bond, *sorted* by ratings and *reduced* to a list.\n\n```objc\nNSArray<Movie *> *moviesByRatings\n    = [[movies filter:isActor(@\"Pierce Brosnan\")]sort:byRatings];\n\nNSString *description\n    = [moviesByRatings reduce:@\"Brosnan movies sorted by ratings:\"\n                   andCombine:^NSString *(NSString *initial, Movie *movie) {\n        return [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%@\\n* %@ (Tomatometer: %@)\",\n                                          initial,\n                                          movie.title,\n                                          @(movie.tomatometer)];\n    }];\n```\n\nVoilà:\n\n```\nBrosnan movies sorted by ratings:\n* GoldenEye (Tomatometer: 82)\n* Die Another Day (Tomatometer: 57)\n* Tomorrow Never Dies (Tomatometer: 57)\n* The World Is Not Enough (Tomatometer: 51)\n```\n\nBut putting all the fun and excitement aside, would I use these methods on an Objective-C project? Probably not — `NSArray` already implements methods for sorting and filtering arrays using `NSPredicate`.\n\nMy point here was to experiment and practice *map*, *filter*, *sort*, *reduce*, and *curried functions*. Programming requires practice. And practicing these techniques and methods (and reimplementing them) in Objective-C improved the way I use them in Swift.\n",
