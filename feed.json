On Monday, we had a holiday, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Monday\">Easter Monday</a>, and, as the day was beautiful, we took <em>tinyScientist</em> to a park. It was his first time on a swing (for babies), and he loved it!</p>\n<p>I like visiting different places, but I hate traveling. A simple 3-hour flight means a whole day of preparations, trains, airport, security checks, etc… but we don’t have teleportation yet, so…</p>\n<h2 id=\"working-vacationing-hacking-partying\">Working? Vacationing? Hacking? Partying?</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>This week we had our Workation and almost all of <a href=\"https://nordsecurity.com/\">Nord Security</a> traveled to a resort in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey\">Turkey</a> 🇹🇷; more than 1000 people flew from different parts of the World to our 2023 gathering. That’s not a typo, 10^3+ people traveled to our event…</p>\n<h3 id=\"wednesday\">Wednesday</h3>\n<p>For me, it all started with a train ride to the airport. Although the airport is far from the city center, public transit works and the express train runs from the Hauptbahnhof to the airport terminal in about 20–25 minutes.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"thursday\">Thursday</h3>\n<p>We arrived at the resort around 2am after a long flight and bus ride from the Antalya airport to the hotel. The main restaurant and bar are open until 6am, so after checking in, we headed there for dinner.</p>\n<p>I missed the city tour in the morning, I was exhausted and barely remember turning off the alarm. I woke up around 10am for a late breakfast, followed by a visit to the Sea. And then back for lunch.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>There’s an hour time difference between Antalya and Germany, so after lunch I FaceTimed home to watch <em>tinyScientist</em> having his lunch.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon, I worked on my <a href=\"https://omg.lol/\">omg.lol</a> for macOS with the most amazing view, and spent the rest of the day chatting with folks from work. Implemented the <code>WebpageNetworkService</code> for the Webpage feature, responsible for all the network calls.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>After dinner, I went to my room to FaceTime scientist and <em>tinyScientist</em> again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"friday\">Friday</h3>\n<p>On Thursday, I went to bed around 9 or 10 pm, planning to wake up earlier on Friday to see the sunrise. I got up around 5:30 am, packed my things and walked to the private beach. Since almost everyone was partying on the night before, I was the only one on the beach in the morning.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Once I was done taking pictures, I sat in a chair, listening to the Mediterranean Sea (and some birds). Priceless. I can’t remember when was the last time I did something like this. Good thing my AirPods Pro had no juice.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Another good reason to wake up early: breakfast before everyone else. I didn’t make healthier choices and ate scrambled eggs, egg with vegetables and boiled potatoes.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I spent the rest of the morning socializing with teammates until lunch, which I skipped. The good thing is that all restaurants in the hotel are open 24/7, so having a late lunch is not a problem.</p>\n<p>I found time to do some more work on my <a href=\"https://omg.lol/\">omg.lol</a> client. Implemented the <code>WebpagePersistenceService</code> and the <code>WebpageRepository</code>. The first responsible for storing the webpage (and history of changes) on Core Data, and the latter the abstraction on top of the network and persistence services. The glue.</p>\n<p>Found a Starbucks inside the resort, next to one of the pools. Since this is an all-inclusive resort, Starbucks is also included. Perfect for cold drinks next to the beach or a pool.</p>\n<p>At 4pm, we had our Q1 OKRs meeting with the entire company, followed by dinner and the OKR party.

				"content_text": "## Personal\n\nAnother short week in Germany 🇩🇪. On Monday, we had a holiday, [Easter Monday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Monday), and, as the day was beautiful, we took *tinyScientist* to a park. It was his first time on a swing (for babies), and he loved it!\n\nI like visiting different places, but I hate traveling. A simple 3-hour flight means a whole day of preparations, trains, airport, security checks, etc… but we don’t have teleportation yet, so…\n\n## Working? Vacationing? Hacking? Partying?\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/d9b42a8868.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\nThis week we had our Workation and almost all of [Nord Security](https://nordsecurity.com/) traveled to a resort in [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey) 🇹🇷; more than 1000 people flew from different parts of the World to our 2023 gathering. That’s not a typo, 10^3+ people traveled to our event…\n\n### Wednesday\n\nFor me, it all started with a train ride to the airport. Although the airport is far from the city center, public transit works and the express train runs from the Hauptbahnhof to the airport terminal in about 20–25 minutes.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/a487555583.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\n### Thursday\n\nWe arrived at the resort around 2am after a long flight and bus ride from the Antalya airport to the hotel. The main restaurant and bar are open until 6am, so after checking in, we headed there for dinner.\n\nI missed the city tour in the morning, I was exhausted and barely remember turning off the alarm. I woke up around 10am for a late breakfast, followed by a visit to the Sea. And then back for lunch.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/30e182d0f7.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\nThere’s an hour time difference between Antalya and Germany, so after lunch I FaceTimed home to watch *tinyScientist* having his lunch.\n\nIn the afternoon, I worked on my [omg.lol](https://omg.lol/) for macOS with the most amazing view, and spent the rest of the day chatting with folks from work. Implemented the `WebpageNetworkService` for the Webpage feature, responsible for all the network calls.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/1eca7587db.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"\" />\n\nAfter dinner, I went to my room to FaceTime scientist and *tinyScientist* again.\n\n### Friday\n\nOn Thursday, I went to bed around 9 or 10 pm, planning to wake up earlier on Friday to see the sunrise. I got up around 5:30 am, packed my things and walked to the private beach. Since almost everyone was partying on the night before, I was the only one on the beach in the morning.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/5dff03b165.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/92d086db4b.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\nOnce I was done taking pictures, I sat in a chair, listening to the Mediterranean Sea (and some birds). Priceless. I can’t remember when was the last time I did something like this. Good thing my AirPods Pro had no juice.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/6d7d2a556b.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/8ec7918886.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/68331e30ac.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/e09f01a88b.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\nAnother good reason to wake up early: breakfast before everyone else. I didn’t make healthier choices and ate scrambled eggs, egg with vegetables and boiled potatoes.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/b67f1e0877.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\nI spent the rest of the morning socializing with teammates until lunch, which I skipped. The good thing is that all restaurants in the hotel are open 24/7, so having a late lunch is not a problem.\n\nI found time to do some more work on my [omg.lol](https://omg.lol/) client. Implemented the `WebpagePersistenceService` and the `WebpageRepository`. The first responsible for storing the webpage (and history of changes) on Core Data, and the latter the abstraction on top of the network and persistence services. The glue.\n\nFound a Starbucks inside the resort, next to one of the pools. Since this is an all-inclusive resort, Starbucks is also included. Perfect for cold drinks next to the beach or a pool.\n\nAt 4pm, we had our Q1 OKRs meeting with the entire company, followed by dinner and the OKR party. The OKR meeting was the only work part of the workation.\n\nBut before the party, I finished the Webpage Feature implementation and can now update [otavio.lol](https://otavio.lol/) using it.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/410ccc312d.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" />\n\n### Saturday\n\nI intended to take more pictures of the sun rising, but I overslept and woke up at 6:30. At that time, the sun was already out there, so I went straight to breakfast. Omelet, bread, and cheese.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/c239d54f9f.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\nAnd then headed out to my favorite spot in the whole resort.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/f7340eedad.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\nImplemented the SwiftUI previews for the Webpage UI and then joined some folks from my team by one of the pools, drinking an Iced Coffee Americano from the hotel’s Starbucks.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/089c5bbe42.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"\" />\n\nI felt guilt for my food choices and decided to eat better during lunch.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/5d0a68a37c.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\nAfter lunch, I must have coffee, so I did.

Thinking again, Obsidian (and some other apps) offer something Bear doesn't: access to the notes without having to use the their app. Obsidian uses simple [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/) files in the file system, while Bear stores all notes and assets in a *sqlite* database, hidden away from the user.\n\nPortability is an important thing nowadays, especially with so many apps hiding their features behind subscriptions. With simple Markdown files I can edit my notes with anything, including my beloved [Vim](https://www.vim.org/).\n\n## Work\n\nAnother short week at work, 7th of April was the first day of Easter (Good Friday). But I went to the office twice, on Monday and Wednesday, for 1-on-1s with the folks from my team, to support them with their Development Plans.\n\n## Hacking\n\nI had plans to work on the Webpage Feature of my native [omg.lol](https://omg.lol) client for macOS, but decided to work a little bit on [Micro.publish](https://otavio.cc/micropublish/), my Obsidian plugin to post to Micro.blog.\n\nReadwise's plugin for Obsidian automatically fetches highlights and notes when Obsidian launches, so I decided to do the same for Micro.blog categories. Now, when the user opens Obsidian, it fetches the categories one has on their blogs.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/1ad84ecafd.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" />\n\nThe command to force fetch categories is still present and can be used at any time to retrieve categories (e.g., in case new categories were added directly to Micro.blog while Obsidian was open).\n\nAnother feature I've added is the ability to schedule a post for a future date. I usually don't scheduled my posts, but it's a nice feature to have.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/389bea7b4a.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" />\n\nI've also updated [my blog](https://otavio.cc/)'s colors to match the Obsidian dark theme I use, and used Xcode dark colors for the [code snippets](https://otavio.cc/mocks/). Feels much more natural to me now.\n\n## Photography\n\nDuring the week I published another page to my [Digital Garden](https://otavio.cc/kleingarten/), [Obscura](https://otavio.cc/obscura/), where I detail the setup I have to take Monochrome photos using the app.\n\nLater during the week I updated the page to include the missing piece in my setup, which was causing Glass not to show the EXIF of my photos.\n\nAfter talking to [Ben](https://mastodon.social/@BenRiceM), Software Engineer behind Obscura, we found what was missing, and now my setup is exactly the way I wanted it to be: Monochrome photos by default, saving JPEG SOOC, and with EXIF preserved, ready to share online (or not).\n",

				"content_html": "<p>About a month ago I decided to build a new app to attend a personal need, a desktop client for <a href=\"https://pinboard.in\">Pinboard</a>, a service I&rsquo;ve been using for over a decade to store and manage my bookmarks.</p>\n<p>As any application which requires internet to fetch and update data, my client needed a way to detect network accessibility. For a long time the strategy adopted by engineers in this situation was to rely on Apple&rsquo;s Reachability class, a sample code the company used to provide for download on their developer portal. Well, either that or one of the many CocoaPods frameworks the community built to replace Apple&rsquo;s drag-and-drop solution. But since iOS 12.0 and macOS 10.14 there&rsquo;s a powerfull first-party alternative.</p>\n<p>Introduced a couple of years ago, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpathmonitor\"><code>NWPathMonitor</code></a> is the easiest way to detect network changes (and retrieve connection properties). Its interface is extremely simple to use, providing a callback to get notified of updates.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#fff;background-color:#1f1f24;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-swift\" data-lang=\"swift\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#fc5fa3\">let</span> <span style=\"color:#41a1c0\">monitor</span> = NWPathMonitor()\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#fc5fa3\">let</span> <span style=\"color:#41a1c0\">queue</span> = DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background)\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>monitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path <span style=\"color:#fc5fa3\">in</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    <span style=\"color:#a167e6\">print</span>(path.status) <span style=\"color:#6c7986\">// .unsatisfied, .satisfied, .requiresConnection</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>}\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>monitor.start(\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    queue: queue\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>)\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#6c7986\">// ...</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>monitor.stop()\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>My application in built in SwiftUI (2.0) and Combine and the solution above wouldn&rsquo;t <em>feel right</em> in my View Model.

Turns out <code>URLSession</code>, familiar to every iOS/macOS engineer, is the perfect example since it requires <code>URLSession.resume()</code> to be called to fire the network requrest. Recently <code>URLSession</code> got a new method, a <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/3329707-datataskpublisher\">publisher</a> which starts the request at the moment there&rsquo;s demand (a subscriber):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#fff;background-color:#1f1f24;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-swift\" data-lang=\"swift\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#fc5fa3\">let</span> <span style=\"color:#41a1c0\">session</span> = URLSession.shared\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#fc5fa3\">let</span> <span style=\"color:#41a1c0\">cancellable</span> = session\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    .dataTaskPublisher(<span style=\"color:#fc5fa3\">for</span>: request)\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    .tryMap { result <span style=\"color:#fc5fa3\">in</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>        <span style=\"color:#6c7986\">// ...</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    }\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    .sink(\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>        receiveCompletion: { <span style=\"color:#fc5fa3\">_</span> <span style=\"color:#fc5fa3\">in</span> },\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>        receiveValue: { <span style=\"color:#fc5fa3\">_</span> <span style=\"color:#fc5fa3\">in</span> }    \n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    )\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And that&rsquo;s the interface I wanted for my monitor.

Building this client is helping me to explore and learn new APIs.</p>\n<p>The protocols <code>Publisher</code>, <code>Subscriber</code>, and <code>Subscription</code> are examples of these APIs. To implement a custom publisher it&rsquo;s necessary to implement types conforming to two of these protocols.</p>\n<p>First, a quick recap:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher\"><code>Publisher</code></a> is the type which emits events over time,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber/\"><code>Subscriber</code></a> is the type which receives events published by the publisher, and</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscription\"><code>Subscription</code></a> implements the link between publishers and subscribers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first step was to define my publisher interface. Since the monitor requires a queue to run, I decided to pass the queue as argument. In order to simplify its interface, a background queue is passed by default to the implementation.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#fff;background-color:#1f1f24;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-swift\" data-lang=\"swift\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#fc5fa3\">extension</span> <span style=\"color:#5dd8ff\">NWPathMonitor</span> {\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>  \n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    <span style=\"color:#fc5fa3\">public</span> <span style=\"color:#fc5fa3\">func</span> <span style=\"color:#41a1c0\">pathUpdatePublisher</span>(\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>        on queue: DispatchQueue = .global(qos: .background)\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    ) -&gt; NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher {\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>      <span style=\"color:#6c7986\">// ...</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    }\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>}\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The interface provides a hint of the first type to be implemented, <code>NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher</code>.

				"content_text": "About a month ago I decided to build a new app to attend a personal need, a desktop client for [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in), a service I've been using for over a decade to store and manage my bookmarks.\n\nAs any application which requires internet to fetch and update data, my client needed a way to detect network accessibility. For a long time the strategy adopted by engineers in this situation was to rely on Apple's Reachability class, a sample code the company used to provide for download on their developer portal. Well, either that or one of the many CocoaPods frameworks the community built to replace Apple's drag-and-drop solution. But since iOS 12.0 and macOS 10.14 there's a powerfull first-party alternative.\n\nIntroduced a couple of years ago, [`NWPathMonitor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpathmonitor) is the easiest way to detect network changes (and retrieve connection properties). Its interface is extremely simple to use, providing a callback to get notified of updates.\n\n```swift\nlet monitor = NWPathMonitor()\nlet queue = DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background)\n\nmonitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path in\n    print(path.status) // .unsatisfied, .satisfied, .requiresConnection\n}\n\nmonitor.start(\n    queue: queue\n)\n\n// ...\n\nmonitor.stop()\n```\n\nMy application in built in SwiftUI (2.0) and Combine and the solution above wouldn't *feel right* in my View Model. So I started with a simple wrapper, hiding the monitor and exposing a publisher which notifies path changes. \n\n```swift\nlet wrapper = NWPathMonitorWrapper()\n\nlet cancellable = wrapper\n    .pathUpdatePublisher()\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .sink { path in\n        print(path.status)\n    }\n\nwrapper.start()\n```\n\nBut the implementation (below) still requires `NWPathMonitorWrapper.start()` to be called, hurting the beauty of the publisher-subscriber relationship.\n\n```swift\npublic final class NWPathMonitorWrapper {\n\n    // MARK: - Properties\n\n    private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n    private let queue: DispatchQueue = .global(qos: .background)\n    private let pathUpdateSubject = PassthroughSubject<NWPath, Never>()\n\n    // MARK: - Life cycle\n\n    public init(\n        monitor: NWPathMonitor = NWPathMonitor()\n    ) {\n        self.monitor = monitor\n        self.monitor.pathUpdateHandler = {\n            self.pathUpdateSubject.send($0)\n        }\n    }\n\n    // MARK: - Public\n\n    public func start() {\n        monitor.start(\n            queue: queue\n        )\n    }\n\n    public func stop() {\n        monitor.cancel()\n    }\n\n    public func pathUpdatePublisher() -> AnyPublisher<NWPath, Never> {\n        pathUpdateSubject\n            .eraseToAnyPublisher()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo I looked for a similar example in Apple's frameworks, one which requires a method to be called to trigger the action. Turns out `URLSession`, familiar to every iOS/macOS engineer, is the perfect example since it requires `URLSession.resume()` to be called to fire the network requrest. Recently `URLSession` got a new method, a [publisher](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/3329707-datataskpublisher) which starts the request at the moment there's demand (a subscriber):\n\n```swift\nlet session = URLSession.shared\n\nlet cancellable = session\n    .dataTaskPublisher(for: request)\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .tryMap { result in\n        // ...\n    }\n    .sink(\n        receiveCompletion: { _ in },\n        receiveValue: { _ in }    \n    )\n```\n\nAnd that's the interface I wanted for my monitor. A simple publisher which starts *emitting values* as soon as there's demand.\n\n```swift\nlet monitor = NWPathMonitor()\n\nlet cancellable = monitor\n    .pathUpdatePublisher()\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .sink { path in\n        print(path.status)\n    } \n```\n\nSwiftUI and Combine are new to me, I spiked and re-implemented some UI components I have up in my sleeve, but nothing too complex. Building this client is helping me to explore and learn new APIs.\n\nThe protocols `Publisher`, `Subscriber`, and `Subscription` are examples of these APIs. To implement a custom publisher it's necessary to implement types conforming to two of these protocols.\n\nFirst, a quick recap:\n\n* [`Publisher`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher) is the type which emits events over time,\n* [`Subscriber`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber/) is the type which receives events published by the publisher, and\n* [`Subscription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscription) implements the link between publishers and subscribers.\n\nThe first step was to define my publisher interface. Since the monitor requires a queue to run, I decided to pass the queue as argument. In order to simplify its interface, a background queue is passed by default to the implementation.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n  \n    public func pathUpdatePublisher(\n        on queue: DispatchQueue = .global(qos: .background)\n    ) -> NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher {\n      // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe interface provides a hint of the first type to be implemented, `NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher`. Most of the code is boilerplate, and for this publisher, the `Output` expected is `NWPath`, without a `Failure`.\n\nWhen the publisher *receives* a subscriber, the link between them is established.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n   \n  public struct PathMonitorPublisher: Publisher {\n\n        // MARK: - Nested types\n    \n        public typealias Output = NWPath\n        public typealias Failure = Never\n    \n        // MARK: - Properties\n    \n        private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n        private let queue: DispatchQueue\n    \n        // MARK: - Life cycle\n    \n        fileprivate init(\n            monitor: NWPathMonitor,\n            queue: DispatchQueue\n        ) {\n            self.monitor = monitor\n            self.queue = queue\n        }\n    \n        // MARK: - Public\n    \n        public func receive<S>(\n            subscriber: S\n        ) where S: Subscriber, S.Failure == Failure, S.Input == Output {\n            let subscription = PathMonitorSubscription(\n                subscriber: subscriber,\n                monitor: monitor,\n                queue: queue\n            )\n    \n            subscriber.receive(\n                subscription: subscription\n            )\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `Subscription` fulfills the demand from the subscriber. As soon as there's demand, it starts monitoring changes using the monitor's callback, passing changes to the subscriber. And since `Subscription` conforms to [`Cancellable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/Cancellable), `cancel()` can be used to stop the monitor.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n\n    private final class PathMonitorSubscription<\n        S: Subscriber\n    >: Subscription where S.Input == NWPath {\n\n        // MARK: - Nested types\n  \n        private let subscriber: S\n        private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n        private let queue: DispatchQueue\n  \n        // MARK: - Life cycle\n  \n        init(\n            subscriber: S,\n            monitor: NWPathMonitor,\n            queue: DispatchQueue\n        ) {\n            self.subscriber = subscriber\n            self.monitor = monitor\n            self.queue = queue\n        }\n  \n        // MARK: - Public\n  \n        func request(\n            _ demand: Subscribers.Demand\n        ) {\n            guard\n                demand == .unlimited,\n                monitor.pathUpdateHandler == nil\n            else {\n                return\n            }\n  \n            monitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path in\n                _ = self.subscriber.receive(path)\n            }\n  \n            monitor.start(\n                queue: queue\n            )\n        }\n  \n        func cancel() {\n            monitor.cancel()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith all in place, the View Model becomes extremely simple and elegant. Below a View Model which publishes a boolean indicating the connectivity status to the View.\n\n```swift\nfinal class ViewModel: ObservableObject {\n\n    // MARK: - Properties\n\n    @Published var isConnected: Bool = false\n    private var monitorCancellable: Cancellable?\n\n    // MARK: - Life cycle\n\n    init(\n        pathMonitorPublisher: NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher\n    ) {\n        monitorCancellable = pathMonitorPublisher\n            .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n            .map { $0.status == .satisfied }\n            .assign(to: \\.isConnected, on: self)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOverall, I'm happy with the result, and am looking forward to using Combine (and SwiftUI) in production.\n\nResources:\n\n* [Using Combine](https://heckj.github.io/swiftui-notes/)\n* [Introducing Combine](https://www.apeth.com/UnderstandingCombine/start.html)\n",

I decided it was time to experiment with *curried functions*, *map*, *filter*, *sort*, and *reduce* in Objective-C.\n\nSwift collections implement *map*, *sort*, *filter*, and *reduce*, so the first step on my experiment was to reimplement these in a `NSArray` category, trying to match the method signature that Swift implements.\n\n* **Map**: given a *transform operation*, it returns a new `NSArray` where all its elements are transformed according to the operation. The *transform operation* takes an object and returns another object (that might be of a different type of the original object).\n* **Filter**: given a *condition operation*, it returns a new `NSArray` where all its elements satisfy the condition. The *condition operation* takes an object and returns a boolean.\n* **Sort**: given a *sort condition*, it returns a new `NSArray` where all its elements are sorted according to the condition. The *sort condition* takes two objects and returns a boolean.\n* **Reduce**: given a *combine operation*, it returns a recombined object by recursively processing its constituent parts. The *combine operation* takes the initial state and an object and returns a recombined object which is of the same type of the initial state.\n\nThe `NSArray` category ended up with the following interface:\n\n```objc\ntypedef id(^Transform)(id);\ntypedef BOOL(^Condition)(id);\ntypedef BOOL(^SortCondition)(id, id);\ntypedef id(^Combine)(id, id);\n\n[@interface](https://micro.blog/interface) NSArray (MFSR)\n\n- (NSArray *)map:(Transform)transform;\n- (NSArray *)filter:(Condition)condition;\n- (NSArray *)sort:(SortCondition)isOrderedBefore;\n- (id)reduce:(id)initial andCombine:(Combine)combine;\n\n@end\n```\n\nTo test the interface above and its implementation, I started with a immutable array of movies — James Bond movies — loaded from a *plist* file.\n\n```objc\nNSArray<Movie *> *movies = [[NSBundle mainBundle] moviesFromPlist];\n```\n\nWhere each movie contains a title, the actor’s name who played Bond, and some additional information about about the flick. The movie interface is defined as:\n\n```objc\n@interface Movie : NSObject\n\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSString *title;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSString *actor;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSInteger year;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat boxOffice;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat budget;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat tomatometer;\n\n@end\n```\n\n*Sorting* the array of movies requires a *sort condition* that takes two movies and returns a boolean that represents the relationship between them. So, for sorting all the British Secret Service agent movies by budget:\n\n```objc\nBOOL(^byBudget)(Movie *, Movie *) = ^BOOL(Movie *a, Movie *b) {\n    return a.budget > b.budget;\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *moviesByBudget = [movies sort:byBudget];\n```\n\nSimple.\n\nFor *filtering*, the method requires a movie and returns *true* when the movie matches the condition and *false* otherwise. Below, a simple way to create an immutable array containing the Sean Connery movies.\n\n```objc\nBOOL(^isConnery)(Movie *) = ^BOOL(Movie *a) {\n    return [a.actor isEqual:@\"Sean Connery\"];\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *conneryMovies = [movies filter:isConnery];\n```\n\nBut here is the tricky part. To filter movies played by other actors, more blocks like the one above would be required. The *functional* way to address this is using curried functions — popular technique in Swift (and in other Functional Programming languages).\n\nSince *filter* expects a block that takes a movie and returns a boolean, another function is required, where its output is a function matching this signature.\n\nThe new function takes a string (actor’s name) and returns a function that takes a movie and returns a boolean.\n\n```objc\ntypedef BOOL(^FuncMovieToBool)(Movie *);\n\nFuncMovieToBool(^isActor)(NSString *) = ^FuncMovieToBool(NSString *actor) {\n    return ^BOOL(Movie *movie) {\n        return [movie.actor isEqual:actor];\n    };\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *actorMovies = [movies filter:isActor(@\"Daniel Craig\")];\n```\n\nWithout any changes to the *filter* method signature or implementation, it’s possible to filter the array of movies to get a list of movies played by any actor on the big screen.\n\nFinally, it’s possible to combine all these functions to achieve the desired result. Let’s say I want the movies were Pierce Brosnan played James Bond, *sorted* by ratings and *reduced* to a list.\n\n```objc\nNSArray<Movie *> *moviesByRatings\n    = [[movies filter:isActor(@\"Pierce Brosnan\")]sort:byRatings];\n\nNSString *description\n    = [moviesByRatings reduce:@\"Brosnan movies sorted by ratings:\"\n                   andCombine:^NSString *(NSString *initial, Movie *movie) {\n        return [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%@\\n* %@ (Tomatometer: %@)\",\n                                          initial,\n                                          movie.title,\n                                          @(movie.tomatometer)];\n    }];\n```\n\nVoilà:\n\n```\nBrosnan movies sorted by ratings:\n* GoldenEye (Tomatometer: 82)\n* Die Another Day (Tomatometer: 57)\n* Tomorrow Never Dies (Tomatometer: 57)\n* The World Is Not Enough (Tomatometer: 51)\n```\n\nBut putting all the fun and excitement aside, would I use these methods on an Objective-C project? Probably not — `NSArray` already implements methods for sorting and filtering arrays using `NSPredicate`.\n\nMy point here was to experiment and practice *map*, *filter*, *sort*, *reduce*, and *curried functions*. Programming requires practice. And practicing these techniques and methods (and reimplementing them) in Objective-C improved the way I use them in Swift.\n",
