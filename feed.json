				"content_html": "<p>For about three years I had the chance to work in the most interesting setup I experienced in my professional career. At first it might sound complicated to maintain, but trust me, it&rsquo;s not. The results speak for themselves.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming\"><strong>Pair Programming</strong></a> for 8 hours per day. Working in pairs was the default in our <em>development team</em>, with rare exceptions such as someone on sick leave or in jury duty <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>. Some might think Pair Programming is hard to achieve and questions such as &ldquo;<em>Who drives?</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<em>When is it the time to switch?</em>&rdquo; “<em>What does one do while the other is coding?</em>” are always asked when I mention Pair Programming to someone not familiar with the technique.</p>\n<p>These questions are totally valid, and I risk to say I don&rsquo;t have the answers for an environment which doesn&rsquo;t do <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development\"><strong>Test Driven Development</strong></a> (TDD). Alongside Pair Programming, TDD was at the core of our culture. When in combination with Pair Programming, TDD defines the boundaries for the <em>driver</em> <sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>, making clear the moment engineers should switch: one writes a test, which should fail, and the other the code which makes the test pass. Once the test passes, the person who just implemented the code writes the next test so the <em>ping-pong</em> can continue. At the end of the day everyone ended up writing the same amount of code.</p>\n<p>While TDD helps to build better and structured code with clear contracts and interfaces <sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>, Pair Programming gives the chance to discuss every step of the process, from architectural to code design decisions.</p>\n<p>In a team of 10 engineers, pairing indefinitely with the same person wasn&rsquo;t an option for us. We wanted all the engineers to have the opportunity to work with each other, and in different areas of our mobile application (and <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Backend+for+Frontend+BFF\">Backend for Frontend</a>, BFF). So we had <strong>rotation</strong>. Two engineers would never pair for more than one consecutive day. If Alice and Bob are pairing today, tomorrow one of them hands over the position to Carol. If Alice gives her spot to Carol on the second day, the next move is Bob switching with Dave. on the third day.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>Day 1:   Alice + Bob\nDay 2:           Bob + Carol\nDay 3:                 Carol + Dave\n</code></pre><p>The overlap is fundamental for knowledge transfer.</p>\n<p>Which brings me to another topic: <strong>Lanes</strong>. We had lanes of work, which are closer to <em>Epics</em> than <em>Missions</em> or <em>Verticals</em>. Lanes implement complete features and might exist from a couple of days to a few weeks and, in most cases, are completely independent from each other. E.g., photo backup, new settings menu, mosaics to make a collage of pictures, etc&hellip;</p>\n<p>Each engineer was in a lane for two days before jumping to another lane (thus the overlap for knowledge transfer in the example above).</p>\n<p>The benefits are obvious. While Pair Programming with TDD makes sure engineers are delivering the best at their best, rotation makes sure they have the whole picture of what they are putting in production (from engineering and product perspective).</p>\n<p>This setup promotes a feeling of shared ownership, where everyone is responsible for the product and technical decisions. The constant rotation also gives a chance to make adjustments to the technical choices made on previous days. It&rsquo;s always better to correct the direction sooner than later, reducing <em>technical debt</em>.</p>\n<p>Formal Code Review - e.g., via Pull Requests - doesn&rsquo;t exist in this setup. Code Review happens in real time by the pair working on the feature, and commits can be merged into the main branch at any time during the day (and multiple times in most cases).</p>\n<p>Having a shared ownership simplifies communication in the team, questions can be addressed by any person or pair at any time. Every engineer has all the knowledge and context to answer questions from the Product Owner, give/ask feedback to Designers, or interact with external teams. It also eliminates that feeling of &ldquo;<em>this is my code and I don&rsquo;t want anyone to touch it</em>&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>The last, but not least, important piece of the puzzle is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pow_wow\">Pow Wow</a>. Whenever a pair would like to discuss something with other engineers, they would call for a Pow Wow. A ceremony as simple as everyone standing up to discuss a technical decision for 5-10 minutes. No formalities, no meeting rooms nor calendar invitations.</p>\n<p>Since we were all on the same page about technical topics, it was pretty easy to size User Stories during planning meetings. Almost three years working with the same team gave us confidence to perfectly size our 1-week sprints, simplifying our backlog refinement sessions and plannings. For our Product Owner this was extremely valuable in order to maintain the backlog relevant and prioritized.</p>\n<p>As a result we had a fast paced and united team, sharing every aspect of the development process, delivering high quality code with confidence, releasing updates every week, and supporting the Product Owner and Designers. We eliminated time waste by doing Code Review in real time, and technical debt by addressing <em>bad</em> choices sooner than later.</p>\n<p>Of course this is just part of the story, only covering our engineering ways of working. Equally important is the <em>partnership</em> with the Product Owner and Designers, but that&rsquo;s a topic for another post.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>We had a list of chores in our backlog for when someone had to <em>solo</em>.

Some might think Pair Programming is hard to achieve and questions such as \"*Who drives?*\", \"*When is it the time to switch?*\" “*What does one do while the other is coding?*” are always asked when I mention Pair Programming to someone not familiar with the technique.\n\nThese questions are totally valid, and I risk to say I don't have the answers for an environment which doesn't do [**Test Driven Development**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD). Alongside Pair Programming, TDD was at the core of our culture. When in combination with Pair Programming, TDD defines the boundaries for the *driver* [^b], making clear the moment engineers should switch: one writes a test, which should fail, and the other the code which makes the test pass. Once the test passes, the person who just implemented the code writes the next test so the *ping-pong* can continue. At the end of the day everyone ended up writing the same amount of code.\n\nWhile TDD helps to build better and structured code with clear contracts and interfaces [^c], Pair Programming gives the chance to discuss every step of the process, from architectural to code design decisions.\n\nIn a team of 10 engineers, pairing indefinitely with the same person wasn't an option for us. We wanted all the engineers to have the opportunity to work with each other, and in different areas of our mobile application (and [Backend for Frontend](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Backend+for+Frontend+BFF), BFF). So we had **rotation**. Two engineers would never pair for more than one consecutive day. If Alice and Bob are pairing today, tomorrow one of them hands over the position to Carol. If Alice gives her spot to Carol on the second day, the next move is Bob switching with Dave. on the third day.\n\n```\nDay 1:   Alice + Bob\nDay 2:           Bob + Carol\nDay 3:                 Carol + Dave\n```\n\nThe overlap is fundamental for knowledge transfer.\n\nWhich brings me to another topic: **Lanes**. We had lanes of work, which are closer to *Epics* than *Missions* or *Verticals*. Lanes implement complete features and might exist from a couple of days to a few weeks and, in most cases, are completely independent from each other. E.g., photo backup, new settings menu, mosaics to make a collage of pictures, etc...\n\nEach engineer was in a lane for two days before jumping to another lane (thus the overlap for knowledge transfer in the example above).\n\nThe benefits are obvious. While Pair Programming with TDD makes sure engineers are delivering the best at their best, rotation makes sure they have the whole picture of what they are putting in production (from engineering and product perspective).\n\nThis setup promotes a feeling of shared ownership, where everyone is responsible for the product and technical decisions. The constant rotation also gives a chance to make adjustments to the technical choices made on previous days. It's always better to correct the direction sooner than later, reducing *technical debt*.\n\nFormal Code Review - e.g., via Pull Requests - doesn't exist in this setup. Code Review happens in real time by the pair working on the feature, and commits can be merged into the main branch at any time during the day (and multiple times in most cases). \n\nHaving a shared ownership simplifies communication in the team, questions can be addressed by any person or pair at any time. Every engineer has all the knowledge and context to answer questions from the Product Owner, give/ask feedback to Designers, or interact with external teams. It also eliminates that feeling of \"*this is my code and I don't want anyone to touch it*\".\n\nThe last, but not least, important piece of the puzzle is the [Pow Wow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pow_wow). Whenever a pair would like to discuss something with other engineers, they would call for a Pow Wow. A ceremony as simple as everyone standing up to discuss a technical decision for 5-10 minutes. No formalities, no meeting rooms nor calendar invitations.\n\nSince we were all on the same page about technical topics, it was pretty easy to size User Stories during planning meetings. Almost three years working with the same team gave us confidence to perfectly size our 1-week sprints, simplifying our backlog refinement sessions and plannings. For our Product Owner this was extremely valuable in order to maintain the backlog relevant and prioritized.\n\nAs a result we had a fast paced and united team, sharing every aspect of the development process, delivering high quality code with confidence, releasing updates every week, and supporting the Product Owner and Designers. We eliminated time waste by doing Code Review in real time, and technical debt by addressing *bad* choices sooner than later.\n\nOf course this is just part of the story, only covering our engineering ways of working. Equally important is the *partnership* with the Product Owner and Designers, but that's a topic for another post.\n\n[^a]: We had a list of chores in our backlog for when someone had to *solo*. Simple tickets with lower priority.\n[^b]: We didn't use the terms *driver* and *navigator*. In fact, we didn't have names for these roles.\n[^c]: I don't see TDD as a tool to write tests, but as a framework to help me to write better code.\n",

Turns out <code>URLSession</code>, familiar to every iOS/macOS engineer, is the perfect example since it requires <code>URLSession.resume()</code> to be called to fire the network requrest. Recently <code>URLSession</code> got a new method, a <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/3329707-datataskpublisher\">publisher</a> which starts the request at the moment there&rsquo;s demand (a subscriber):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-swift\" data-lang=\"swift\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> session = URLSession.shared\n\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> cancellable = session\n    .dataTaskPublisher(<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">for</span>: request)\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .tryMap { result <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">in</span>\n        <span style=\"color:#75715e\">// ...</span>\n    }\n    .sink(\n        receiveCompletion: { <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">_</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">in</span> },\n        receiveValue: { <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">_</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">in</span> }    \n    )\n</code></pre></div><p>And that&rsquo;s the interface I wanted for my monitor. A simple publisher which starts <em>emitting values</em> as soon as there&rsquo;s demand.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-swift\" data-lang=\"swift\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> monitor = NWPathMonitor()\n\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">let</span> cancellable = monitor\n    .pathUpdatePublisher()\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .sink { path <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">in</span>\n        print(path.status)\n    } \n</code></pre></div><p>SwiftUI and Combine are new to me, I spiked and re-implemented some UI components I have up in my sleeve, but nothing too complex. Building this client is helping me to explore and learn new APIs.</p>\n<p>The protocols <code>Publisher</code>, <code>Subscriber</code>, and <code>Subscription</code> are examples of these APIs. To implement a custom publisher it&rsquo;s necessary to implement types conforming to two of these protocols.</p>\n<p>First, a quick recap:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher\"><code>Publisher</code></a> is the type which emits events over time,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber/\"><code>Subscriber</code></a> is the type which receives events published by the publisher, and</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscription\"><code>Subscription</code></a> implements the link between publishers and subscribers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first step was to define my publisher interface. Since the monitor requires a queue to run, I decided to pass the queue as argument. In order to simplify its interface, a background queue is passed by default to the implementation.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-swift\" data-lang=\"swift\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">extension</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">NWPathMonitor</span> {\n  \n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">public</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">func</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">pathUpdatePublisher</span>(\n        on queue: DispatchQueue = .global(qos: .background)\n    ) -&gt; NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher {\n      <span style=\"color:#75715e\">// ...</span>\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>The interface provides a hint of the first type to be implemented, <code>NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher</code>.

So I started with a simple wrapper, hiding the monitor and exposing a publisher which notifies path changes. \n\n```swift\nlet wrapper = NWPathMonitorWrapper()\n\nlet cancellable = wrapper\n    .pathUpdatePublisher()\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .sink { path in\n        print(path.status)\n    }\n\nwrapper.start()\n```\n\nBut the implementation (below) still requires `NWPathMonitorWrapper.start()` to be called, hurting the beauty of the publisher-subscriber relationship.\n\n```swift\npublic final class NWPathMonitorWrapper {\n\n    // MARK: - Properties\n\n    private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n    private let queue: DispatchQueue = .global(qos: .background)\n    private let pathUpdateSubject = PassthroughSubject<NWPath, Never>()\n\n    // MARK: - Life cycle\n\n    public init(\n        monitor: NWPathMonitor = NWPathMonitor()\n    ) {\n        self.monitor = monitor\n        self.monitor.pathUpdateHandler = {\n            self.pathUpdateSubject.send($0)\n        }\n    }\n\n    // MARK: - Public\n\n    public func start() {\n        monitor.start(\n            queue: queue\n        )\n    }\n\n    public func stop() {\n        monitor.cancel()\n    }\n\n    public func pathUpdatePublisher() -> AnyPublisher<NWPath, Never> {\n        pathUpdateSubject\n            .eraseToAnyPublisher()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo I looked for a similar example in Apple's frameworks, one which requires a method to be called to trigger the action. Turns out `URLSession`, familiar to every iOS/macOS engineer, is the perfect example since it requires `URLSession.resume()` to be called to fire the network requrest. Recently `URLSession` got a new method, a [publisher](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/3329707-datataskpublisher) which starts the request at the moment there's demand (a subscriber):\n\n```swift\nlet session = URLSession.shared\n\nlet cancellable = session\n    .dataTaskPublisher(for: request)\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .tryMap { result in\n        // ...\n    }\n    .sink(\n        receiveCompletion: { _ in },\n        receiveValue: { _ in }    \n    )\n```\n\nAnd that's the interface I wanted for my monitor. A simple publisher which starts *emitting values* as soon as there's demand.\n\n```swift\nlet monitor = NWPathMonitor()\n\nlet cancellable = monitor\n    .pathUpdatePublisher()\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .sink { path in\n        print(path.status)\n    } \n```\n\nSwiftUI and Combine are new to me, I spiked and re-implemented some UI components I have up in my sleeve, but nothing too complex. Building this client is helping me to explore and learn new APIs.\n\nThe protocols `Publisher`, `Subscriber`, and `Subscription` are examples of these APIs. To implement a custom publisher it's necessary to implement types conforming to two of these protocols.\n\nFirst, a quick recap:\n\n* [`Publisher`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher) is the type which emits events over time,\n* [`Subscriber`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber/) is the type which receives events published by the publisher, and\n* [`Subscription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscription) implements the link between publishers and subscribers.\n\nThe first step was to define my publisher interface. Since the monitor requires a queue to run, I decided to pass the queue as argument. In order to simplify its interface, a background queue is passed by default to the implementation.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n  \n    public func pathUpdatePublisher(\n        on queue: DispatchQueue = .global(qos: .background)\n    ) -> NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher {\n      // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe interface provides a hint of the first type to be implemented, `NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher`. Most of the code is boilerplate, and for this publisher, the `Output` expected is `NWPath`, without a `Failure`.\n\nWhen the publisher *receives* a subscriber, the link between them is established.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n   \n  public struct PathMonitorPublisher: Publisher {\n\n        // MARK: - Nested types\n    \n        public typealias Output = NWPath\n        public typealias Failure = Never\n    \n        // MARK: - Properties\n    \n        private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n        private let queue: DispatchQueue\n    \n        // MARK: - Life cycle\n    \n        fileprivate init(\n            monitor: NWPathMonitor,\n            queue: DispatchQueue\n        ) {\n            self.monitor = monitor\n            self.queue = queue\n        }\n    \n        // MARK: - Public\n    \n        public func receive<S>(\n            subscriber: S\n        ) where S: Subscriber, S.Failure == Failure, S.Input == Output {\n            let subscription = PathMonitorSubscription(\n                subscriber: subscriber,\n                monitor: monitor,\n                queue: queue\n            )\n    \n            subscriber.receive(\n                subscription: subscription\n            )\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `Subscription` fulfills the demand from the subscriber. As soon as there's demand, it starts monitoring changes using the monitor's callback, passing changes to the subscriber. And since `Subscription` conforms to [`Cancellable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/Cancellable), `cancel()` can be used to stop the monitor.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n\n    private final class PathMonitorSubscription<\n        S: Subscriber\n    >: Subscription where S.Input == NWPath {\n\n        // MARK: - Nested types\n  \n        private let subscriber: S\n        private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n        private let queue: DispatchQueue\n  \n        // MARK: - Life cycle\n  \n        init(\n            subscriber: S,\n            monitor: NWPathMonitor,\n            queue: DispatchQueue\n        ) {\n            self.subscriber = subscriber\n            self.monitor = monitor\n            self.queue = queue\n        }\n  \n        // MARK: - Public\n  \n        func request(\n            _ demand: Subscribers.Demand\n        ) {\n            guard\n                demand == .unlimited,\n                monitor.pathUpdateHandler == nil\n            else {\n                return\n            }\n  \n            monitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path in\n                _ = self.subscriber.receive(path)\n            }\n  \n            monitor.start(\n                queue: queue\n            )\n        }\n  \n        func cancel() {\n            monitor.cancel()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith all in place, the View Model becomes extremely simple and elegant. Below a View Model which publishes a boolean indicating the connectivity status to the View.\n\n```swift\nfinal class ViewModel: ObservableObject {\n\n    // MARK: - Properties\n\n    @Published var isConnected: Bool = false\n    private var monitorCancellable: Cancellable?\n\n    // MARK: - Life cycle\n\n    init(\n        pathMonitorPublisher: NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher\n    ) {\n        monitorCancellable = pathMonitorPublisher\n            .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n            .map { $0.status == .satisfied }\n            .assign(to: \\.isConnected, on: self)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOverall, I'm happy with the result, and am looking forward to using Combine (and SwiftUI) in production.\n\nResources:\n\n* [Using Combine](https://heckj.github.io/swiftui-notes/)\n* [Introducing Combine](https://www.apeth.com/UnderstandingCombine/start.html)\n",

				"content_text": "Like them or not, [type methods](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Methods.html), aka *class methods* or *static methods*, are heavily used in Swift and part of our daily lives as developers. \n\nFrom analytics trackers to requesting system permissions, we’ve all had to face type methods from external libraries in which we had no control over. Testing code that interacts with them might seem hard without using [method swizzling](http://nshipster.com/method-swizzling/), but fortunately, this doesn't always have to be the case.\n\nLet's suppose there's a class called `APIWrapper`, which implements a type method that requests search results from an endpoint.\n\n```swift\npublic class APIWrapper {\n    public static func search(\n        query: String,\n        completion: @escaping (Result<[String], Error>) -> Void\n    )\n}\n```\n\nThe method takes a query, `String`, and a completion block, `(Result<[String], Error>) -> Void`, which is triggered once the request finishes. Its internal implementation doesn't really matter since it could be from an external framework or generated by a [code generator](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) from the API specification.\n\nConsuming the method is straightforward:\n\n```swift\nAPIWrapper.search(query: \"fancy restaurant\") { result in\n    // do something with 'result'\n}\n```\n\nBut testing the part of the application that interacts with it isn't that obvious. Especially when we want to:\n\n1. avoid making real network requests\n2. stress all the possibilities the interface allows. For instance:\n   - Is the search method called with the correct query string?\n   - What happens when the completion block returns an empty array?\n   - What happens when the completion block returns an array of results?\n   - What happens when the completion block is called with an error?\n\n### **Basic Data Source implementation**\n\nThe snippet below shows `SearchResultsTableViewDataSource`, a `UITableViewDataSource` subclass which uses the API wrapper to populate the table view when the network request completes. Testing it triggers a real network request and doesn't provide what's needed to test the query passed to the wrapper and the different behaviors when the result returns.\n\n```swift\nfinal class SearchResultsTableViewDataSource: NSObject,\n                                              UITableViewDataSource {\n    private let tableView: UITableView\n    private var results: [String] = []\n\n    init(\n        tableView: UITableView\n    ) {\n        self.tableView = tableView\n    }\n\n    func fetchSearchResuls(query: String) {\n        APIWrapper.search(\n            query: query\n        ) { [weak self] result in\n            switch result {\n            case .success(let results): self?.results = results\n            case .failure: self?.results = []\n            }\n            self?.tableView.reloadData()\n        }\n    }\n\n    // ... UITableViewDataSource methods ...\n}\n```\n\nIf `APIWrapper` had an instance method instead of a type method, two easy and obvious solutions would emerge: *protocols* and *subclasses*. Using either/or it would be possible to replace the wrapper with a [test double](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html) that captures the query parameter and completion block for verifying expectations.\n\n### **Dependency injection to the rescue**\n\nIn the example above, the API wrapper interface can't be changed and has to stay as a type method, therefore the easiest way to overcome this is via [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection). In this case, *method injection* via object initialization\n\nThe code below stores a method which matches the qualified symbol name of the wrapper method, using it to perform the search. In order to simplify the `SearchResultsTableViewDataSource` interface, the wrapper's search method is assigned using a [default parameter value](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Functions.html#ID169).\n\n```swift\nfinal class SearchResultsTableViewDataSource: NSObject,\n                                              UITableViewDataSource {\n    typealias SearcherCompletion\n        = (Result<[String], Error>) -> Void\n    typealias Searcher\n        = (String, @escaping SearcherCompletion) -> Void\n\n    private let tableView: UITableView\n    private var results: [String] = []\n    private var searcher: Searcher\n\n    init(\n        tableView: UITableView,\n        searcher: @escaping Searcher = APIWrapper.search(query:completion:)\n    ) {\n        self.tableView = tableView\n        self.searcher = searcher\n    }\n\n    func fetchSearchResuls(query: String) {\n        searcher(query) { [weak self] result in\n            switch result {\n            case .success(let results): self?.results = results\n            case .failure: self?.results = []\n            }\n            self?.tableView.reloadData()\n        }\n    }\n\n    // ... UITableViewDataSource methods ...\n}\n```\n\n### **Testing with Dependency Injection**\n\nFinally, testing becomes trivial. The injected method is used to capture the query term and the completion block passed to the API wrapper. Once captured, these can be used to verify expectations.\n\n```swift\nfinal class SearchResultsTableViewDataSourceTests: XCTestCase {\n    var tableView: UITableView!\n    var dataSource: SearchResultsTableViewDataSource?\n    var lastSearchQuery: String?\n    var lastSearchCompletion:\n        SearchResultsTableViewDataSource.SearcherCompletion?\n\n    override func setUp() {\n        super.setUp()\n\n        tableView = UITableView()\n\n        dataSource = SearchResultsTableViewDataSource(\n            tableView: tableView\n        ) { query, completion in\n            self.lastSearchQuery = query\n            self.lastSearchCompletion = completion\n        }\n    }\n\n    func testFetchSearchResultsQuery() {\n        // When the method is called\n        dataSource?.fetchSearchResuls(query: \"Mocked Search Query\")\n\n        XCTAssertEqual(\n            lastSearchQuery,\n            \"Mocked Search Query\",\n            \"It calls the API wrapper with the correct search query\"\n        )\n    }\n\n    func testFetchSearchResultsWithoutResults() {\n        // When the method is called\n        dataSource?.fetchSearchResuls(query: \"Mocked Search Query\")\n\n        // And the API wrapper completion block is called with an empty array\n        lastSearchCompletion?(.success([]))\n\n        XCTAssertEqual(\n            dataSource?.tableView(tableView, numberOfRowsInSection: 0),\n            0,\n            \"It empties the table view\"\n        )\n    }\n\n    func testFetchSearchResultsWithResults() {\n        // When the method is called\n        dataSource?.fetchSearchResuls(query: \"Mocked Search Query\")\n\n        // And the API wrapper completion block is called with results\n        lastSearchCompletion?(.success([\"result 1\", \"result 2\"]))\n\n        XCTAssertEqual(\n            dataSource?.tableView(tableView, numberOfRowsInSection: 0),\n            2,\n            \"It adds the correct number of results to the table view\"\n        )\n\n        XCTAssertEqual(\n            dataSource?.tableView(\n                tableView,\n                cellForRowAt: IndexPath(row: 0, section: 0)\n            ).textLabel?.text,\n            \"result 1\",\n            \"It configures the first cell\"\n        )\n\n        XCTAssertEqual(\n            dataSource?.tableView(\n                tableView,\n                cellForRowAt: IndexPath(row: 1, section: 0)\n            ).textLabel?.text,\n            \"result 2\",\n            \"It configures the second cell\"\n        )\n    }\n\n    func testFetchSearchResultsWithError() {\n        // When the method is called\n        dataSource?.fetchSearchResuls(query: \"Mocked Search Query\")\n\n        // And the API wrapper completion block is called with an error\n        enum MockError: Error { case someGenericError }\n        lastSearchCompletion?(.failure(MockError.someGenericError))\n\n        XCTAssertEqual(\n            dataSource?.tableView(tableView, numberOfRowsInSection: 0),\n            0,\n            \"It empties the table view\"\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\nMore importantly, not only does this method work with type methods but also with *free functions*, such as `SecItemAdd(_:_:)` used to [add items to the Keychain](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/1401659-secitemadd).\n",

The *combine operation* takes the initial state and an object and returns a recombined object which is of the same type of the initial state.\n\nThe `NSArray` category ended up with the following interface:\n\n```objc\ntypedef id(^Transform)(id);\ntypedef BOOL(^Condition)(id);\ntypedef BOOL(^SortCondition)(id, id);\ntypedef id(^Combine)(id, id);\n\n[@interface](https://micro.blog/interface) NSArray (MFSR)\n\n- (NSArray *)map:(Transform)transform;\n- (NSArray *)filter:(Condition)condition;\n- (NSArray *)sort:(SortCondition)isOrderedBefore;\n- (id)reduce:(id)initial andCombine:(Combine)combine;\n\n@end\n```\n\nTo test the interface above and its implementation, I started with a immutable array of movies — James Bond movies — loaded from a *plist* file.\n\n```objc\nNSArray<Movie *> *movies = [[NSBundle mainBundle] moviesFromPlist];\n```\n\nWhere each movie contains a title, the actor’s name who played Bond, and some additional information about about the flick. The movie interface is defined as:\n\n```objc\n@interface Movie : NSObject\n\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSString *title;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSString *actor;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSInteger year;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat boxOffice;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat budget;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat tomatometer;\n\n@end\n```\n\n*Sorting* the array of movies requires a *sort condition* that takes two movies and returns a boolean that represents the relationship between them. So, for sorting all the British Secret Service agent movies by budget:\n\n```objc\nBOOL(^byBudget)(Movie *, Movie *) = ^BOOL(Movie *a, Movie *b) {\n    return a.budget > b.budget;\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *moviesByBudget = [movies sort:byBudget];\n```\n\nSimple.\n\nFor *filtering*, the method requires a movie and returns *true* when the movie matches the condition and *false* otherwise. Below, a simple way to create an immutable array containing the Sean Connery movies.\n\n```objc\nBOOL(^isConnery)(Movie *) = ^BOOL(Movie *a) {\n    return [a.actor isEqual:@\"Sean Connery\"];\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *conneryMovies = [movies filter:isConnery];\n```\n\nBut here is the tricky part. To filter movies played by other actors, more blocks like the one above would be required. The *functional* way to address this is using curried functions — popular technique in Swift (and in other Functional Programming languages).\n\nSince *filter* expects a block that takes a movie and returns a boolean, another function is required, where its output is a function matching this signature.\n\nThe new function takes a string (actor’s name) and returns a function that takes a movie and returns a boolean.\n\n```objc\ntypedef BOOL(^FuncMovieToBool)(Movie *);\n\nFuncMovieToBool(^isActor)(NSString *) = ^FuncMovieToBool(NSString *actor) {\n    return ^BOOL(Movie *movie) {\n        return [movie.actor isEqual:actor];\n    };\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *actorMovies = [movies filter:isActor(@\"Daniel Craig\")];\n```\n\nWithout any changes to the *filter* method signature or implementation, it’s possible to filter the array of movies to get a list of movies played by any actor on the big screen.\n\nFinally, it’s possible to combine all these functions to achieve the desired result. Let’s say I want the movies were Pierce Brosnan played James Bond, *sorted* by ratings and *reduced* to a list.\n\n```objc\nNSArray<Movie *> *moviesByRatings\n    = [[movies filter:isActor(@\"Pierce Brosnan\")]sort:byRatings];\n\nNSString *description\n    = [moviesByRatings reduce:@\"Brosnan movies sorted by ratings:\"\n                   andCombine:^NSString *(NSString *initial, Movie *movie) {\n        return [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%@\\n* %@ (Tomatometer: %@)\",\n                                          initial,\n                                          movie.title,\n                                          @(movie.tomatometer)];\n    }];\n```\n\nVoilà:\n\n```\nBrosnan movies sorted by ratings:\n* GoldenEye (Tomatometer: 82)\n* Die Another Day (Tomatometer: 57)\n* Tomorrow Never Dies (Tomatometer: 57)\n* The World Is Not Enough (Tomatometer: 51)\n```\n\nBut putting all the fun and excitement aside, would I use these methods on an Objective-C project? Probably not — `NSArray` already implements methods for sorting and filtering arrays using `NSPredicate`.\n\nMy point here was to experiment and practice *map*, *filter*, *sort*, *reduce*, and *curried functions*. Programming requires practice. And practicing these techniques and methods (and reimplementing them) in Objective-C improved the way I use them in Swift.\n",
