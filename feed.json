For some reason I enjoy coding on trains, buses, and airplanes. Especially when it‚Äôs raining outside. A wonderful combination of white noise sounds, I suppose.</p>\n<p><em>tinyScientist</em> went to the doctor for his <em>U-Untersuchungen</em> and took some other vaccines. My wife has a Phd in vaccine development working with viruses, so of course <em>tinyScientist</em> won‚Äôt miss a single shot.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday I returned to work after two weeks off and had my contract updated to match my new title: Engineering Team Lead. Never have I imagined I would take such kind of role, but the setup we have in the company works so well that I decided to accept the challenge. I‚Äôm glad I have the time to write code and lead a team.</p>\n<p>Internet in Germany has its ups and downs; probably more downs than ups.

				"content_text": "Earlier this week I took my parents to the airport and had the opportunity to work on my side project on the train on my way back home. For some reason I enjoy coding on trains, buses, and airplanes. Especially when it‚Äôs raining outside. A wonderful combination of white noise sounds, I suppose.\n\n_tinyScientist_ went to the doctor for his _U-Untersuchungen_ and took some other vaccines. My wife has a Phd in vaccine development working with viruses, so of course _tinyScientist_ won‚Äôt miss a single shot.\n\nOn Tuesday I returned to work after two weeks off and had my contract updated to match my new title: Engineering Team Lead. Never have I imagined I would take such kind of role, but the setup we have in the company works so well that I decided to accept the challenge. I‚Äôm glad I have the time to write code and lead a team.\n\nInternet in Germany has its ups and downs; probably more downs than ups. This week my Internet Provider gave me money back because the service is too unstable in my area, I had to use my phone as personal hotspot in 30% of the meetings I attended.\n\nEarlier this year LEGO released the [Series 24](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-minifigures-series-24-71037) of its minifigures. We went to a store to _feel the packages_, as we always do, and found 10 minifigures. Still missing 2.\n\nAnd finally, I canceled Audible.

For a long time the strategy adopted by engineers in this situation was to rely on Apple&rsquo;s Reachability class, a sample code the company used to provide for download on their developer portal. Well, either that or one of the many CocoaPods frameworks the community built to replace Apple&rsquo;s drag-and-drop solution. But since iOS 12.0 and macOS 10.14 there&rsquo;s a powerfull first-party alternative.</p>\n<p>Introduced a couple of years ago, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpathmonitor\"><code>NWPathMonitor</code></a> is the easiest way to detect network changes (and retrieve connection properties). Its interface is extremely simple to use, providing a callback to get notified of updates.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#d8dee9;background-color:#2e3440;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-swift\" data-lang=\"swift\"><span style=\"color:#81a1c1;font-weight:bold\">let</span> monitor <span style=\"color:#eceff4\">=</span> NWPathMonitor<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">()</span>\n<span style=\"color:#81a1c1;font-weight:bold\">let</span> queue <span style=\"color:#eceff4\">=</span> DispatchQueue<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">.</span>global<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">(</span>qos<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#eceff4\">.</span>background<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">)</span>\n\nmonitor<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">.</span>pathUpdateHandler <span style=\"color:#eceff4\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#eceff4\">{</span> path <span style=\"color:#81a1c1;font-weight:bold\">in</span>\n    print<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">(</span>path<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">.</span>status<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">)</span> <span style=\"color:#616e87;font-style:italic\">// .unsatisfied, .satisfied, .requiresConnection</span>\n<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">}</span>\n\nmonitor<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">.</span>start<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">(</span>\n    queue<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">:</span> queue\n<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">)</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:#616e87;font-style:italic\">// ...</span>\n\nmonitor<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">.</span>stop<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">()</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>My application in built in SwiftUI (2.0) and Combine and the solution above wouldn&rsquo;t <em>feel right</em> in my View Model.

Building this client is helping me to explore and learn new APIs.</p>\n<p>The protocols <code>Publisher</code>, <code>Subscriber</code>, and <code>Subscription</code> are examples of these APIs. To implement a custom publisher it&rsquo;s necessary to implement types conforming to two of these protocols.</p>\n<p>First, a quick recap:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher\"><code>Publisher</code></a> is the type which emits events over time,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber/\"><code>Subscriber</code></a> is the type which receives events published by the publisher, and</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscription\"><code>Subscription</code></a> implements the link between publishers and subscribers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first step was to define my publisher interface. Since the monitor requires a queue to run, I decided to pass the queue as argument. In order to simplify its interface, a background queue is passed by default to the implementation.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#d8dee9;background-color:#2e3440;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-swift\" data-lang=\"swift\"><span style=\"color:#81a1c1;font-weight:bold\">extension</span> <span style=\"color:#8fbcbb\">NWPathMonitor</span> <span style=\"color:#eceff4\">{</span>\n  \n    <span style=\"color:#81a1c1;font-weight:bold\">public</span> <span style=\"color:#81a1c1;font-weight:bold\">func</span> <span style=\"color:#88c0d0\">pathUpdatePublisher</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">(</span>\n        on queue<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">:</span> DispatchQueue <span style=\"color:#eceff4\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#eceff4\">.</span>global<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">(</span>qos<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#eceff4\">.</span>background<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">)</span>\n    <span style=\"color:#eceff4\">)</span> <span style=\"color:#eceff4\">-&gt;</span> NWPathMonitor<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">.</span>PathMonitorPublisher <span style=\"color:#eceff4\">{</span>\n      <span style=\"color:#616e87;font-style:italic\">// ...</span>\n    <span style=\"color:#eceff4\">}</span>\n<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>The interface provides a hint of the first type to be implemented, <code>NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher</code>.

				"content_text": "About a month ago I decided to build a new app to attend a personal need, a desktop client for [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in), a service I've been using for over a decade to store and manage my bookmarks.\n\nAs any application which requires internet to fetch and update data, my client needed a way to detect network accessibility. For a long time the strategy adopted by engineers in this situation was to rely on Apple's Reachability class, a sample code the company used to provide for download on their developer portal. Well, either that or one of the many CocoaPods frameworks the community built to replace Apple's drag-and-drop solution. But since iOS 12.0 and macOS 10.14 there's a powerfull first-party alternative.\n\nIntroduced a couple of years ago, [`NWPathMonitor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpathmonitor) is the easiest way to detect network changes (and retrieve connection properties). Its interface is extremely simple to use, providing a callback to get notified of updates.\n\n```swift\nlet monitor = NWPathMonitor()\nlet queue = DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background)\n\nmonitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path in\n    print(path.status) // .unsatisfied, .satisfied, .requiresConnection\n}\n\nmonitor.start(\n    queue: queue\n)\n\n// ...\n\nmonitor.stop()\n```\n\nMy application in built in SwiftUI (2.0) and Combine and the solution above wouldn't *feel right* in my View Model. So I started with a simple wrapper, hiding the monitor and exposing a publisher which notifies path changes. \n\n```swift\nlet wrapper = NWPathMonitorWrapper()\n\nlet cancellable = wrapper\n    .pathUpdatePublisher()\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .sink { path in\n        print(path.status)\n    }\n\nwrapper.start()\n```\n\nBut the implementation (below) still requires `NWPathMonitorWrapper.start()` to be called, hurting the beauty of the publisher-subscriber relationship.\n\n```swift\npublic final class NWPathMonitorWrapper {\n\n    // MARK: - Properties\n\n    private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n    private let queue: DispatchQueue = .global(qos: .background)\n    private let pathUpdateSubject = PassthroughSubject<NWPath, Never>()\n\n    // MARK: - Life cycle\n\n    public init(\n        monitor: NWPathMonitor = NWPathMonitor()\n    ) {\n        self.monitor = monitor\n        self.monitor.pathUpdateHandler = {\n            self.pathUpdateSubject.send($0)\n        }\n    }\n\n    // MARK: - Public\n\n    public func start() {\n        monitor.start(\n            queue: queue\n        )\n    }\n\n    public func stop() {\n        monitor.cancel()\n    }\n\n    public func pathUpdatePublisher() -> AnyPublisher<NWPath, Never> {\n        pathUpdateSubject\n            .eraseToAnyPublisher()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo I looked for a similar example in Apple's frameworks, one which requires a method to be called to trigger the action. Turns out `URLSession`, familiar to every iOS/macOS engineer, is the perfect example since it requires `URLSession.resume()` to be called to fire the network requrest. Recently `URLSession` got a new method, a [publisher](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/3329707-datataskpublisher) which starts the request at the moment there's demand (a subscriber):\n\n```swift\nlet session = URLSession.shared\n\nlet cancellable = session\n    .dataTaskPublisher(for: request)\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .tryMap { result in\n        // ...\n    }\n    .sink(\n        receiveCompletion: { _ in },\n        receiveValue: { _ in }    \n    )\n```\n\nAnd that's the interface I wanted for my monitor. A simple publisher which starts *emitting values* as soon as there's demand.\n\n```swift\nlet monitor = NWPathMonitor()\n\nlet cancellable = monitor\n    .pathUpdatePublisher()\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .sink { path in\n        print(path.status)\n    } \n```\n\nSwiftUI and Combine are new to me, I spiked and re-implemented some UI components I have up in my sleeve, but nothing too complex. Building this client is helping me to explore and learn new APIs.\n\nThe protocols `Publisher`, `Subscriber`, and `Subscription` are examples of these APIs. To implement a custom publisher it's necessary to implement types conforming to two of these protocols.\n\nFirst, a quick recap:\n\n* [`Publisher`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher) is the type which emits events over time,\n* [`Subscriber`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber/) is the type which receives events published by the publisher, and\n* [`Subscription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscription) implements the link between publishers and subscribers.\n\nThe first step was to define my publisher interface. Since the monitor requires a queue to run, I decided to pass the queue as argument. In order to simplify its interface, a background queue is passed by default to the implementation.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n  \n    public func pathUpdatePublisher(\n        on queue: DispatchQueue = .global(qos: .background)\n    ) -> NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher {\n      // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe interface provides a hint of the first type to be implemented, `NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher`. Most of the code is boilerplate, and for this publisher, the `Output` expected is `NWPath`, without a `Failure`.\n\nWhen the publisher *receives* a subscriber, the link between them is established.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n   \n  public struct PathMonitorPublisher: Publisher {\n\n        // MARK: - Nested types\n    \n        public typealias Output = NWPath\n        public typealias Failure = Never\n    \n        // MARK: - Properties\n    \n        private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n        private let queue: DispatchQueue\n    \n        // MARK: - Life cycle\n    \n        fileprivate init(\n            monitor: NWPathMonitor,\n            queue: DispatchQueue\n        ) {\n            self.monitor = monitor\n            self.queue = queue\n        }\n    \n        // MARK: - Public\n    \n        public func receive<S>(\n            subscriber: S\n        ) where S: Subscriber, S.Failure == Failure, S.Input == Output {\n            let subscription = PathMonitorSubscription(\n                subscriber: subscriber,\n                monitor: monitor,\n                queue: queue\n            )\n    \n            subscriber.receive(\n                subscription: subscription\n            )\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `Subscription` fulfills the demand from the subscriber. As soon as there's demand, it starts monitoring changes using the monitor's callback, passing changes to the subscriber. And since `Subscription` conforms to [`Cancellable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/Cancellable), `cancel()` can be used to stop the monitor.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n\n    private final class PathMonitorSubscription<\n        S: Subscriber\n    >: Subscription where S.Input == NWPath {\n\n        // MARK: - Nested types\n  \n        private let subscriber: S\n        private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n        private let queue: DispatchQueue\n  \n        // MARK: - Life cycle\n  \n        init(\n            subscriber: S,\n            monitor: NWPathMonitor,\n            queue: DispatchQueue\n        ) {\n            self.subscriber = subscriber\n            self.monitor = monitor\n            self.queue = queue\n        }\n  \n        // MARK: - Public\n  \n        func request(\n            _ demand: Subscribers.Demand\n        ) {\n            guard\n                demand == .unlimited,\n                monitor.pathUpdateHandler == nil\n            else {\n                return\n            }\n  \n            monitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path in\n                _ = self.subscriber.receive(path)\n            }\n  \n            monitor.start(\n                queue: queue\n            )\n        }\n  \n        func cancel() {\n            monitor.cancel()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith all in place, the View Model becomes extremely simple and elegant. Below a View Model which publishes a boolean indicating the connectivity status to the View.\n\n```swift\nfinal class ViewModel: ObservableObject {\n\n    // MARK: - Properties\n\n    @Published var isConnected: Bool = false\n    private var monitorCancellable: Cancellable?\n\n    // MARK: - Life cycle\n\n    init(\n        pathMonitorPublisher: NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher\n    ) {\n        monitorCancellable = pathMonitorPublisher\n            .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n            .map { $0.status == .satisfied }\n            .assign(to: \\.isConnected, on: self)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOverall, I'm happy with the result, and am looking forward to using Combine (and SwiftUI) in production.\n\nResources:\n\n* [Using Combine](https://heckj.github.io/swiftui-notes/)\n* [Introducing Combine](https://www.apeth.com/UnderstandingCombine/start.html)\n",

Swift is a modern, powerful, and safe language. Its syntax is so simple and elegante that it works as an invitation to dive into the Functional Programming world.</p>\n<p>After practicing Functional Programming in Swift for a few weeks, I decided to try something a little bit different. I decided it was time to experiment with <em>curried functions</em>, <em>map</em>, <em>filter</em>, <em>sort</em>, and <em>reduce</em> in Objective-C.</p>\n<p>Swift collections implement <em>map</em>, <em>sort</em>, <em>filter</em>, and <em>reduce</em>, so the first step on my experiment was to reimplement these in a <code>NSArray</code> category, trying to match the method signature that Swift implements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Map</strong>: given a <em>transform operation</em>, it returns a new <code>NSArray</code> where all its elements are transformed according to the operation. The <em>transform operation</em> takes an object and returns another object (that might be of a different type of the original object).</li>\n<li><strong>Filter</strong>: given a <em>condition operation</em>, it returns a new <code>NSArray</code> where all its elements satisfy the condition. The <em>condition operation</em> takes an object and returns a boolean.</li>\n<li><strong>Sort</strong>: given a <em>sort condition</em>, it returns a new <code>NSArray</code> where all its elements are sorted according to the condition. The <em>sort condition</em> takes two objects and returns a boolean.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce</strong>: given a <em>combine operation</em>, it returns a recombined object by recursively processing its constituent parts. The <em>combine operation</em> takes the initial state and an object and returns a recombined object which is of the same type of the initial state.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>NSArray</code> category ended up with the following interface:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#d8dee9;background-color:#2e3440;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-objc\" data-lang=\"objc\"><span style=\"color:#81a1c1;font-weight:bold\">typedef</span> <span style=\"color:#88c0d0\">id</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">(</span><span style=\"color:#81a1c1\">^</span>Transform<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">)(</span><span style=\"color:#81a1c1\">id</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">);</span>\n<span style=\"color:#81a1c1;font-weight:bold\">typedef</span> <span style=\"color:#88c0d0\">BOOL</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">(</span><span style=\"color:#81a1c1\">^</span>Condition<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">)(</span><span style=\"color:#81a1c1\">id</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">);</span>\n<span style=\"color:#81a1c1;font-weight:bold\">typedef</span> <span style=\"color:#88c0d0\">BOOL</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">(</span><span style=\"color:#81a1c1\">^</span>SortCondition<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">)(</span><span style=\"color:#81a1c1\">id</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">,</span> <span style=\"color:#81a1c1\">id</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">);</span>\n<span style=\"color:#81a1c1;font-weight:bold\">typedef</span> <span style=\"color:#88c0d0\">id</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">(</span><span style=\"color:#81a1c1\">^</span>Combine<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">)(</span><span style=\"color:#81a1c1\">id</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">,</span> <span style=\"color:#81a1c1\">id</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">);</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">[@</span>interface<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">](</span><span style=\"color:#8fbcbb\">https</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">:</span><span style=\"color:#616e87;font-style:italic\">//micro.blog/interface) NSArray (MFSR)\n</span><span style=\"color:#616e87;font-style:italic\"></span>\n<span style=\"color:#81a1c1\">-</span> <span style=\"color:#eceff4\">(</span>NSArray <span style=\"color:#81a1c1\">*</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">)</span><span style=\"color:#8fbcbb\">map</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">:(</span>Transform<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">)</span>transform<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">-</span> <span style=\"color:#eceff4\">(</span>NSArray <span style=\"color:#81a1c1\">*</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">)</span><span style=\"color:#88c0d0\">filter:</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">(</span>Condition<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">)</span>condition<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">-</span> <span style=\"color:#eceff4\">(</span>NSArray <span style=\"color:#81a1c1\">*</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">)</span><span style=\"color:#88c0d0\">sort:</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">(</span>SortCondition<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">)</span>isOrderedBefore<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">-</span> <span style=\"color:#eceff4\">(</span><span style=\"color:#81a1c1\">id</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">)</span><span style=\"color:#88c0d0\">reduce:</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">(</span><span style=\"color:#81a1c1\">id</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">)</span>initial <span style=\"color:#88c0d0\">andCombine:</span><span style=\"color:#eceff4\">(</span>Combine<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">)</span>combine<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">;</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:#81a1c1;font-weight:bold\">@end</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>To test the interface above and its implementation, I started with a immutable array of movies‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäJames Bond movies‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääloaded from a <em>plist</em> file.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#d8dee9;background-color:#2e3440;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-objc\" data-lang=\"objc\">NSArray<span style=\"color:#81a1c1\">&lt;</span>Movie <span style=\"color:#81a1c1\">*&gt;</span> <span style=\"color:#81a1c1\">*</span>movies <span style=\"color:#81a1c1\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#eceff4\">[[</span>NSBundle mainBundle<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">]</span> moviesFromPlist<span style=\"color:#eceff4\">];</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>Where each movie contains a title, the actor‚Äôs name who played Bond, and some additional information about about the flick.

				"content_text": "I strongly believe that the best way to learn something new is by experimenting and practicing it.\n\nA few months ago I was studying *Functional Programming in Swift*. Swift is a modern, powerful, and safe language. Its syntax is so simple and elegante that it works as an invitation to dive into the Functional Programming world.\n\nAfter practicing Functional Programming in Swift for a few weeks, I decided to try something a little bit different. I decided it was time to experiment with *curried functions*, *map*, *filter*, *sort*, and *reduce* in Objective-C.\n\nSwift collections implement *map*, *sort*, *filter*, and *reduce*, so the first step on my experiment was to reimplement these in a `NSArray` category, trying to match the method signature that Swift implements.\n\n* **Map**: given a *transform operation*, it returns a new `NSArray` where all its elements are transformed according to the operation. The *transform operation* takes an object and returns another object (that might be of a different type of the original object).\n* **Filter**: given a *condition operation*, it returns a new `NSArray` where all its elements satisfy the condition. The *condition operation* takes an object and returns a boolean.\n* **Sort**: given a *sort condition*, it returns a new `NSArray` where all its elements are sorted according to the condition. The *sort condition* takes two objects and returns a boolean.\n* **Reduce**: given a *combine operation*, it returns a recombined object by recursively processing its constituent parts. The *combine operation* takes the initial state and an object and returns a recombined object which is of the same type of the initial state.\n\nThe `NSArray` category ended up with the following interface:\n\n```objc\ntypedef id(^Transform)(id);\ntypedef BOOL(^Condition)(id);\ntypedef BOOL(^SortCondition)(id, id);\ntypedef id(^Combine)(id, id);\n\n[@interface](https://micro.blog/interface) NSArray (MFSR)\n\n- (NSArray *)map:(Transform)transform;\n- (NSArray *)filter:(Condition)condition;\n- (NSArray *)sort:(SortCondition)isOrderedBefore;\n- (id)reduce:(id)initial andCombine:(Combine)combine;\n\n@end\n```\n\nTo test the interface above and its implementation, I started with a immutable array of movies‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäJames Bond movies‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääloaded from a *plist* file.\n\n```objc\nNSArray<Movie *> *movies = [[NSBundle mainBundle] moviesFromPlist];\n```\n\nWhere each movie contains a title, the actor‚Äôs name who played Bond, and some additional information about about the flick. The movie interface is defined as:\n\n```objc\n@interface Movie : NSObject\n\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSString *title;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSString *actor;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSInteger year;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat boxOffice;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat budget;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat tomatometer;\n\n@end\n```\n\n*Sorting* the array of movies requires a *sort condition* that takes two movies and returns a boolean that represents the relationship between them. So, for sorting all the British Secret Service agent movies by budget:\n\n```objc\nBOOL(^byBudget)(Movie *, Movie *) = ^BOOL(Movie *a, Movie *b) {\n    return a.budget > b.budget;\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *moviesByBudget = [movies sort:byBudget];\n```\n\nSimple.\n\nFor *filtering*, the method requires a movie and returns *true* when the movie matches the condition and *false* otherwise. Below, a simple way to create an immutable array containing the Sean Connery movies.\n\n```objc\nBOOL(^isConnery)(Movie *) = ^BOOL(Movie *a) {\n    return [a.actor isEqual:@\"Sean Connery\"];\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *conneryMovies = [movies filter:isConnery];\n```\n\nBut here is the tricky part. To filter movies played by other actors, more blocks like the one above would be required. The *functional* way to address this is using curried functions‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpopular technique in Swift (and in other Functional Programming languages).\n\nSince *filter* expects a block that takes a movie and returns a boolean, another function is required, where its output is a function matching this signature.\n\nThe new function takes a string (actor‚Äôs name) and returns a function that takes a movie and returns a boolean.\n\n```objc\ntypedef BOOL(^FuncMovieToBool)(Movie *);\n\nFuncMovieToBool(^isActor)(NSString *) = ^FuncMovieToBool(NSString *actor) {\n    return ^BOOL(Movie *movie) {\n        return [movie.actor isEqual:actor];\n    };\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *actorMovies = [movies filter:isActor(@\"Daniel Craig\")];\n```\n\nWithout any changes to the *filter* method signature or implementation, it‚Äôs possible to filter the array of movies to get a list of movies played by any actor on the big screen.\n\nFinally, it‚Äôs possible to combine all these functions to achieve the desired result. Let‚Äôs say I want the movies were Pierce Brosnan played James Bond, *sorted* by ratings and *reduced* to a list.\n\n```objc\nNSArray<Movie *> *moviesByRatings\n    = [[movies filter:isActor(@\"Pierce Brosnan\")]sort:byRatings];\n\nNSString *description\n    = [moviesByRatings reduce:@\"Brosnan movies sorted by ratings:\"\n                   andCombine:^NSString *(NSString *initial, Movie *movie) {\n        return [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%@\\n* %@ (Tomatometer: %@)\",\n                                          initial,\n                                          movie.title,\n                                          @(movie.tomatometer)];\n    }];\n```\n\nVoil√†:\n\n```\nBrosnan movies sorted by ratings:\n* GoldenEye (Tomatometer: 82)\n* Die Another Day (Tomatometer: 57)\n* Tomorrow Never Dies (Tomatometer: 57)\n* The World Is Not Enough (Tomatometer: 51)\n```\n\nBut putting all the fun and excitement aside, would I use these methods on an Objective-C project? Probably not‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`NSArray` already implements methods for sorting and filtering arrays using `NSPredicate`.\n\nMy point here was to experiment and practice *map*, *filter*, *sort*, *reduce*, and *curried functions*. Programming requires practice. And practicing these techniques and methods (and reimplementing them) in Objective-C improved the way I use them in Swift.\n",
