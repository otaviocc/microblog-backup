Instead, I&rsquo;ll focus in some of the highlights.</p>\n<h2 id=\"personal\">Personal</h2>\n<p><em>tinyScientist</em> had his first surgery and had to stay in hospital for almost a week for recovery.</p>\n<p>The surgery took seven hours, from the first incision to the last stitch, according to the doctors, followed by another two hours in post-anesthesia recovery. An eternity if you ask us. But we were waiting and preparing for this day since the fourth month of pregnancy, having monthly appointments with doctors and midwife to talk about the surgery, steps for before and after, etc…</p>\n<p>The surgery was a success, and <em>tinyScientist</em> is recovering well. He was exhausted and bored during the week he had to stay hospitalized, but that&rsquo;s all in the past now.</p>\n<p>To celebrate I asked <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/andycarolan/commissions\">Andy Carolan</a> to create profile pictures for the family. They&rsquo;re all awesome, but <em>tinyScientist</em>&rsquo;s is a piece of art.</p>\n<h2 id=\"watching\">Watching</h2>\n<p>Watched two movies recently, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons:_Honor_Among_Thieves\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Super_Mario_Bros._Movie\">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>.</p>\n<p>I was skeptical about <strong>D&amp;D</strong>, but loved the movie. The balance between humor, action, and luck is perfect. Great easter eggs as well!</p>\n<p><strong>Super Mario</strong> is fun, good entertainment. I don’t understand why people were complaining about it. It’s a kids movie, what were they expecting?</p>\n<h2 id=\"playing\">Playing</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda%3A_Tears_of_the_Kingdom\">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> was released the day my son had his surgery. On the day before - thanks Amazon! - I got the standard version and on the release day I got the Collector’s Edition.</p>\n<p>The days after the surgery were extremely busy and I didn’t find time to play it, but this week I finally did. What can I say? It’s even better than the best game ever made (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild\">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>).</p>\n<h2 id=\"reading\">Reading</h2>\n<p>I love a good dystopian story, and when I saw the trailer for <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/originals/silo/\">Silo</a> I decided to buy the <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780358447825\">The Silo Saga</a> to read.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hacking\">Hacking</h2>\n<h3 id=\"micropublish\">Micro.publish</h3>\n<p>A user reported that <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=micro.publish\">Micro.publish</a> allowed to run the publish command with an empty post, resulting in error since Micro.blog doesn’t support empty posts (obviously).</p>\n<p>So I released a minor update - 1.6.0 - fixing it.

				"content_text": "<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/f9f767e8a8.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"199\" alt=\"\" />\n\nThe last notes I wrote are from [Week 2023-18](https://otavio.cc/2023/05/07/no-highlights-this.html), and so many things happened since that post that I won't even try to remember all the details. Instead, I'll focus in some of the highlights.\n\n## Personal\n\n*tinyScientist* had his first surgery and had to stay in hospital for almost a week for recovery.\n\nThe surgery took seven hours, from the first incision to the last stitch, according to the doctors, followed by another two hours in post-anesthesia recovery. An eternity if you ask us. But we were waiting and preparing for this day since the fourth month of pregnancy, having monthly appointments with doctors and midwife to talk about the surgery, steps for before and after, etc…\n\nThe surgery was a success, and *tinyScientist* is recovering well. He was exhausted and bored during the week he had to stay hospitalized, but that's all in the past now.\n\nTo celebrate I asked [Andy Carolan](https://ko-fi.com/andycarolan/commissions) to create profile pictures for the family. They're all awesome, but *tinyScientist*'s is a piece of art.\n\n## Watching\n\nWatched two movies recently, [Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons:_Honor_Among_Thieves) and [The Super Mario Bros. Movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Super_Mario_Bros._Movie).\n\nI was skeptical about **D&D**, but loved the movie. The balance between humor, action, and luck is perfect. Great easter eggs as well!\n\n**Super Mario** is fun, good entertainment. I don’t understand why people were complaining about it. It’s a kids movie, what were they expecting?\n\n## Playing\n\n[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda%3A_Tears_of_the_Kingdom) was released the day my son had his surgery. On the day before - thanks Amazon! - I got the standard version and on the release day I got the Collector’s Edition.\n\nThe days after the surgery were extremely busy and I didn’t find time to play it, but this week I finally did. What can I say? It’s even better than the best game ever made ([The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild)).\n\n## Reading\n\nI love a good dystopian story, and when I saw the trailer for [Silo](https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/originals/silo/) I decided to buy the [The Silo Saga](https://micro.blog/books/9780358447825) to read.\n\n## Hacking\n\n### Micro.publish\n\nA user reported that [Micro.publish](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=micro.publish) allowed to run the publish command with an empty post, resulting in error since Micro.blog doesn’t support empty posts (obviously). \n\nSo I released a minor update - 1.6.0 - fixing it. After the change, users will be prompted with a message saying they have to write something before publishing into Micro.blog.\n\nI’ve also updated the *donate* button inside the Plug-in to use [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/otaviocc) instead of [BuyMeACoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/otaviocc). I like that platform better.\n\n### omg.lol\n\nI’m back working on my [omg.lol](https://omg.lol) client for macOS. Didn’t put much time on it, but was using and testing the app to make sure it looks good for releasing it.\n\n### App.net import\n\n[Quickly wrote a script](https://otavio.cc/2023/06/02/appnet-archive-migrated.html) to download all my App.net posts and published them as a [page in my blog](https://otavio.cc/adn/). I might, someday, import those posts as regular posts in this blog, but for now I'll keep them in a separate page.\n",

The editor was rebuilt from scratch, adding features users were asking for a long time. One of my favorite features is <em>backlinks</em>, something all <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> users know well. Currently Bear supports <code>[[WikiLinks]]</code>, allowing one to link another note (as Obsidian does), but the new version implements <em>backlinks</em>, showing which pages link the one selected. It also shows pages that mention the page but don&rsquo;t link them (<em>Unlinked Mention</em>). This is big! I exported all my <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten\">Zettelkasten</a> notes from Obsidian and imported on Bear and will use it for now on.

It’s not a browser but a <em>bookmark</em> manager. It gives access to Spaces, Easel, and Notes one has on their computer.

For a long time the strategy adopted by engineers in this situation was to rely on Apple&rsquo;s Reachability class, a sample code the company used to provide for download on their developer portal. Well, either that or one of the many CocoaPods frameworks the community built to replace Apple&rsquo;s drag-and-drop solution. But since iOS 12.0 and macOS 10.14 there&rsquo;s a powerfull first-party alternative.</p>\n<p>Introduced a couple of years ago, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpathmonitor\"><code>NWPathMonitor</code></a> is the easiest way to detect network changes (and retrieve connection properties). Its interface is extremely simple to use, providing a callback to get notified of updates.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#1f1f24;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-swift\" data-lang=\"swift\"><span style=\"color:#fc5fa3\">let</span><span style=\"color:#fff\"> </span><span style=\"color:#41a1c0\">monitor</span><span style=\"color:#fff\"> </span><span style=\"color:#fff\">=</span><span style=\"color:#fff\"> </span><span style=\"color:#fff\">NWPathMonitor</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">()</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">\n</span><span style=\"color:#fff\"></span><span style=\"color:#fc5fa3\">let</span><span style=\"color:#fff\"> </span><span style=\"color:#41a1c0\">queue</span><span style=\"color:#fff\"> </span><span style=\"color:#fff\">=</span><span style=\"color:#fff\"> </span><span style=\"color:#fff\">DispatchQueue</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">.</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">global</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">(</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">qos</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">:</span><span style=\"color:#fff\"> </span><span style=\"color:#fff\">.</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">background</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">)</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">\n</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">\n</span><span style=\"color:#fff\"></span><span style=\"color:#fff\">monitor</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">.</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">pathUpdateHandler</span><span style=\"color:#fff\"> </span><span style=\"color:#fff\">=</span><span style=\"color:#fff\"> </span><span style=\"color:#fff\">{</span><span style=\"color:#fff\"> </span><span style=\"color:#fff\">path</span><span style=\"color:#fff\"> </span><span style=\"color:#fc5fa3\">in</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">\n</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">    </span><span style=\"color:#a167e6\">print</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">(</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">path</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">.</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">status</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">)</span><span style=\"color:#fff\"> </span><span style=\"color:#6c7986\">// .unsatisfied, .satisfied, .requiresConnection</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">\n</span><span style=\"color:#fff\"></span><span style=\"color:#fff\">}</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">\n</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">\n</span><span style=\"color:#fff\"></span><span style=\"color:#fff\">monitor</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">.</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">start</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">(</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">\n</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">    </span><span style=\"color:#fff\">queue</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">:</span><span style=\"color:#fff\"> </span><span style=\"color:#fff\">queue</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">\n</span><span style=\"color:#fff\"></span><span style=\"color:#fff\">)</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">\n</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">\n</span><span style=\"color:#fff\"></span><span style=\"color:#6c7986\">// ...</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">\n</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">\n</span><span style=\"color:#fff\"></span><span style=\"color:#fff\">monitor</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">.</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">stop</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">()</span><span style=\"color:#fff\">\n</span></code></pre></div><p>My application in built in SwiftUI (2.0) and Combine and the solution above wouldn&rsquo;t <em>feel right</em> in my View Model.

				"content_text": "About a month ago I decided to build a new app to attend a personal need, a desktop client for [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in), a service I've been using for over a decade to store and manage my bookmarks.\n\nAs any application which requires internet to fetch and update data, my client needed a way to detect network accessibility. For a long time the strategy adopted by engineers in this situation was to rely on Apple's Reachability class, a sample code the company used to provide for download on their developer portal. Well, either that or one of the many CocoaPods frameworks the community built to replace Apple's drag-and-drop solution. But since iOS 12.0 and macOS 10.14 there's a powerfull first-party alternative.\n\nIntroduced a couple of years ago, [`NWPathMonitor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpathmonitor) is the easiest way to detect network changes (and retrieve connection properties). Its interface is extremely simple to use, providing a callback to get notified of updates.\n\n```swift\nlet monitor = NWPathMonitor()\nlet queue = DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background)\n\nmonitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path in\n    print(path.status) // .unsatisfied, .satisfied, .requiresConnection\n}\n\nmonitor.start(\n    queue: queue\n)\n\n// ...\n\nmonitor.stop()\n```\n\nMy application in built in SwiftUI (2.0) and Combine and the solution above wouldn't *feel right* in my View Model. So I started with a simple wrapper, hiding the monitor and exposing a publisher which notifies path changes. \n\n```swift\nlet wrapper = NWPathMonitorWrapper()\n\nlet cancellable = wrapper\n    .pathUpdatePublisher()\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .sink { path in\n        print(path.status)\n    }\n\nwrapper.start()\n```\n\nBut the implementation (below) still requires `NWPathMonitorWrapper.start()` to be called, hurting the beauty of the publisher-subscriber relationship.\n\n```swift\npublic final class NWPathMonitorWrapper {\n\n    // MARK: - Properties\n\n    private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n    private let queue: DispatchQueue = .global(qos: .background)\n    private let pathUpdateSubject = PassthroughSubject<NWPath, Never>()\n\n    // MARK: - Life cycle\n\n    public init(\n        monitor: NWPathMonitor = NWPathMonitor()\n    ) {\n        self.monitor = monitor\n        self.monitor.pathUpdateHandler = {\n            self.pathUpdateSubject.send($0)\n        }\n    }\n\n    // MARK: - Public\n\n    public func start() {\n        monitor.start(\n            queue: queue\n        )\n    }\n\n    public func stop() {\n        monitor.cancel()\n    }\n\n    public func pathUpdatePublisher() -> AnyPublisher<NWPath, Never> {\n        pathUpdateSubject\n            .eraseToAnyPublisher()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo I looked for a similar example in Apple's frameworks, one which requires a method to be called to trigger the action. Turns out `URLSession`, familiar to every iOS/macOS engineer, is the perfect example since it requires `URLSession.resume()` to be called to fire the network requrest. Recently `URLSession` got a new method, a [publisher](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/3329707-datataskpublisher) which starts the request at the moment there's demand (a subscriber):\n\n```swift\nlet session = URLSession.shared\n\nlet cancellable = session\n    .dataTaskPublisher(for: request)\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .tryMap { result in\n        // ...\n    }\n    .sink(\n        receiveCompletion: { _ in },\n        receiveValue: { _ in }    \n    )\n```\n\nAnd that's the interface I wanted for my monitor. A simple publisher which starts *emitting values* as soon as there's demand.\n\n```swift\nlet monitor = NWPathMonitor()\n\nlet cancellable = monitor\n    .pathUpdatePublisher()\n    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n    .sink { path in\n        print(path.status)\n    } \n```\n\nSwiftUI and Combine are new to me, I spiked and re-implemented some UI components I have up in my sleeve, but nothing too complex. Building this client is helping me to explore and learn new APIs.\n\nThe protocols `Publisher`, `Subscriber`, and `Subscription` are examples of these APIs. To implement a custom publisher it's necessary to implement types conforming to two of these protocols.\n\nFirst, a quick recap:\n\n* [`Publisher`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher) is the type which emits events over time,\n* [`Subscriber`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber/) is the type which receives events published by the publisher, and\n* [`Subscription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscription) implements the link between publishers and subscribers.\n\nThe first step was to define my publisher interface. Since the monitor requires a queue to run, I decided to pass the queue as argument. In order to simplify its interface, a background queue is passed by default to the implementation.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n  \n    public func pathUpdatePublisher(\n        on queue: DispatchQueue = .global(qos: .background)\n    ) -> NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher {\n      // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe interface provides a hint of the first type to be implemented, `NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher`. Most of the code is boilerplate, and for this publisher, the `Output` expected is `NWPath`, without a `Failure`.\n\nWhen the publisher *receives* a subscriber, the link between them is established.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n   \n  public struct PathMonitorPublisher: Publisher {\n\n        // MARK: - Nested types\n    \n        public typealias Output = NWPath\n        public typealias Failure = Never\n    \n        // MARK: - Properties\n    \n        private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n        private let queue: DispatchQueue\n    \n        // MARK: - Life cycle\n    \n        fileprivate init(\n            monitor: NWPathMonitor,\n            queue: DispatchQueue\n        ) {\n            self.monitor = monitor\n            self.queue = queue\n        }\n    \n        // MARK: - Public\n    \n        public func receive<S>(\n            subscriber: S\n        ) where S: Subscriber, S.Failure == Failure, S.Input == Output {\n            let subscription = PathMonitorSubscription(\n                subscriber: subscriber,\n                monitor: monitor,\n                queue: queue\n            )\n    \n            subscriber.receive(\n                subscription: subscription\n            )\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `Subscription` fulfills the demand from the subscriber. As soon as there's demand, it starts monitoring changes using the monitor's callback, passing changes to the subscriber. And since `Subscription` conforms to [`Cancellable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/Cancellable), `cancel()` can be used to stop the monitor.\n\n```swift\nextension NWPathMonitor {\n\n    private final class PathMonitorSubscription<\n        S: Subscriber\n    >: Subscription where S.Input == NWPath {\n\n        // MARK: - Nested types\n  \n        private let subscriber: S\n        private let monitor: NWPathMonitor\n        private let queue: DispatchQueue\n  \n        // MARK: - Life cycle\n  \n        init(\n            subscriber: S,\n            monitor: NWPathMonitor,\n            queue: DispatchQueue\n        ) {\n            self.subscriber = subscriber\n            self.monitor = monitor\n            self.queue = queue\n        }\n  \n        // MARK: - Public\n  \n        func request(\n            _ demand: Subscribers.Demand\n        ) {\n            guard\n                demand == .unlimited,\n                monitor.pathUpdateHandler == nil\n            else {\n                return\n            }\n  \n            monitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path in\n                _ = self.subscriber.receive(path)\n            }\n  \n            monitor.start(\n                queue: queue\n            )\n        }\n  \n        func cancel() {\n            monitor.cancel()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith all in place, the View Model becomes extremely simple and elegant. Below a View Model which publishes a boolean indicating the connectivity status to the View.\n\n```swift\nfinal class ViewModel: ObservableObject {\n\n    // MARK: - Properties\n\n    @Published var isConnected: Bool = false\n    private var monitorCancellable: Cancellable?\n\n    // MARK: - Life cycle\n\n    init(\n        pathMonitorPublisher: NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher\n    ) {\n        monitorCancellable = pathMonitorPublisher\n            .receive(on: RunLoop.main)\n            .map { $0.status == .satisfied }\n            .assign(to: \\.isConnected, on: self)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOverall, I'm happy with the result, and am looking forward to using Combine (and SwiftUI) in production.\n\nResources:\n\n* [Using Combine](https://heckj.github.io/swiftui-notes/)\n* [Introducing Combine](https://www.apeth.com/UnderstandingCombine/start.html)\n",

Swift is a modern, powerful, and safe language. Its syntax is so simple and elegante that it works as an invitation to dive into the Functional Programming world.</p>\n<p>After practicing Functional Programming in Swift for a few weeks, I decided to try something a little bit different. I decided it was time to experiment with <em>curried functions</em>, <em>map</em>, <em>filter</em>, <em>sort</em>, and <em>reduce</em> in Objective-C.</p>\n<p>Swift collections implement <em>map</em>, <em>sort</em>, <em>filter</em>, and <em>reduce</em>, so the first step on my experiment was to reimplement these in a <code>NSArray</code> category, trying to match the method signature that Swift implements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Map</strong>: given a <em>transform operation</em>, it returns a new <code>NSArray</code> where all its elements are transformed according to the operation. The <em>transform operation</em> takes an object and returns another object (that might be of a different type of the original object).</li>\n<li><strong>Filter</strong>: given a <em>condition operation</em>, it returns a new <code>NSArray</code> where all its elements satisfy the condition. The <em>condition operation</em> takes an object and returns a boolean.</li>\n<li><strong>Sort</strong>: given a <em>sort condition</em>, it returns a new <code>NSArray</code> where all its elements are sorted according to the condition. The <em>sort condition</em> takes two objects and returns a boolean.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce</strong>: given a <em>combine operation</em>, it returns a recombined object by recursively processing its constituent parts. The <em>combine operation</em> takes the initial state and an object and returns a recombined object which is of the same type of the initial state.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>NSArray</code> category

				"content_text": "I strongly believe that the best way to learn something new is by experimenting and practicing it.\n\nA few months ago I was studying *Functional Programming in Swift*. Swift is a modern, powerful, and safe language. Its syntax is so simple and elegante that it works as an invitation to dive into the Functional Programming world.\n\nAfter practicing Functional Programming in Swift for a few weeks, I decided to try something a little bit different. I decided it was time to experiment with *curried functions*, *map*, *filter*, *sort*, and *reduce* in Objective-C.\n\nSwift collections implement *map*, *sort*, *filter*, and *reduce*, so the first step on my experiment was to reimplement these in a `NSArray` category, trying to match the method signature that Swift implements.\n\n* **Map**: given a *transform operation*, it returns a new `NSArray` where all its elements are transformed according to the operation. The *transform operation* takes an object and returns another object (that might be of a different type of the original object).\n* **Filter**: given a *condition operation*, it returns a new `NSArray` where all its elements satisfy the condition. The *condition operation* takes an object and returns a boolean.\n* **Sort**: given a *sort condition*, it returns a new `NSArray` where all its elements are sorted according to the condition. The *sort condition* takes two objects and returns a boolean.\n* **Reduce**: given a *combine operation*, it returns a recombined object by recursively processing its constituent parts. The *combine operation* takes the initial state and an object and returns a recombined object which is of the same type of the initial state.\n\nThe `NSArray` category ended up with the following interface:\n\n```objc\ntypedef id(^Transform)(id);\ntypedef BOOL(^Condition)(id);\ntypedef BOOL(^SortCondition)(id, id);\ntypedef id(^Combine)(id, id);\n\n[@interface](https://micro.blog/interface) NSArray (MFSR)\n\n- (NSArray *)map:(Transform)transform;\n- (NSArray *)filter:(Condition)condition;\n- (NSArray *)sort:(SortCondition)isOrderedBefore;\n- (id)reduce:(id)initial andCombine:(Combine)combine;\n\n@end\n```\n\nTo test the interface above and its implementation, I started with a immutable array of movies — James Bond movies — loaded from a *plist* file.\n\n```objc\nNSArray<Movie *> *movies = [[NSBundle mainBundle] moviesFromPlist];\n```\n\nWhere each movie contains a title, the actor’s name who played Bond, and some additional information about about the flick. The movie interface is defined as:\n\n```objc\n@interface Movie : NSObject\n\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSString *title;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSString *actor;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSInteger year;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat boxOffice;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat budget;\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGFloat tomatometer;\n\n@end\n```\n\n*Sorting* the array of movies requires a *sort condition* that takes two movies and returns a boolean that represents the relationship between them. So, for sorting all the British Secret Service agent movies by budget:\n\n```objc\nBOOL(^byBudget)(Movie *, Movie *) = ^BOOL(Movie *a, Movie *b) {\n    return a.budget > b.budget;\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *moviesByBudget = [movies sort:byBudget];\n```\n\nSimple.\n\nFor *filtering*, the method requires a movie and returns *true* when the movie matches the condition and *false* otherwise. Below, a simple way to create an immutable array containing the Sean Connery movies.\n\n```objc\nBOOL(^isConnery)(Movie *) = ^BOOL(Movie *a) {\n    return [a.actor isEqual:@\"Sean Connery\"];\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *conneryMovies = [movies filter:isConnery];\n```\n\nBut here is the tricky part. To filter movies played by other actors, more blocks like the one above would be required. The *functional* way to address this is using curried functions — popular technique in Swift (and in other Functional Programming languages).\n\nSince *filter* expects a block that takes a movie and returns a boolean, another function is required, where its output is a function matching this signature.\n\nThe new function takes a string (actor’s name) and returns a function that takes a movie and returns a boolean.\n\n```objc\ntypedef BOOL(^FuncMovieToBool)(Movie *);\n\nFuncMovieToBool(^isActor)(NSString *) = ^FuncMovieToBool(NSString *actor) {\n    return ^BOOL(Movie *movie) {\n        return [movie.actor isEqual:actor];\n    };\n};\n\nNSArray<Movie *> *actorMovies = [movies filter:isActor(@\"Daniel Craig\")];\n```\n\nWithout any changes to the *filter* method signature or implementation, it’s possible to filter the array of movies to get a list of movies played by any actor on the big screen.\n\nFinally, it’s possible to combine all these functions to achieve the desired result. Let’s say I want the movies were Pierce Brosnan played James Bond, *sorted* by ratings and *reduced* to a list.\n\n```objc\nNSArray<Movie *> *moviesByRatings\n    = [[movies filter:isActor(@\"Pierce Brosnan\")]sort:byRatings];\n\nNSString *description\n    = [moviesByRatings reduce:@\"Brosnan movies sorted by ratings:\"\n                   andCombine:^NSString *(NSString *initial, Movie *movie) {\n        return [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%@\\n* %@ (Tomatometer: %@)\",\n                                          initial,\n                                          movie.title,\n                                          @(movie.tomatometer)];\n    }];\n```\n\nVoilà:\n\n```\nBrosnan movies sorted by ratings:\n* GoldenEye (Tomatometer: 82)\n* Die Another Day (Tomatometer: 57)\n* Tomorrow Never Dies (Tomatometer: 57)\n* The World Is Not Enough (Tomatometer: 51)\n```\n\nBut putting all the fun and excitement aside, would I use these methods on an Objective-C project? Probably not — `NSArray` already implements methods for sorting and filtering arrays using `NSPredicate`.\n\nMy point here was to experiment and practice *map*, *filter*, *sort*, *reduce*, and *curried functions*.

				"content_text": "[Function Currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) and *uncurrying* have been extensively discussed since Apple introduced Swift in 2014. I won’t extend myself on this topic because there are some great resources about it on the Internet.\n\nBut, shortly, what is currying? It’s a technique that transforms a function that takes several arguments into a sequence of functions, each with a single argument. The result is a chain of functions returning functions. It’s beautiful, it’s mathematics!\n\nBelow, a simple example in Swift:\n\n```swift\nfunc add(_ a: Int) -> (Int) -> (Int) -> Int {\n    { b in { c in a + b + c } }\n}\n\nlet addTwo = add(2)               // Int -> Int -> Int\nlet addFive = addTwo(3)           // Int -> Int\nlet result = addFive(4)           // 9\n\nprint(\"result = \\(result)\")       // result = 9\n```\n\nand the same example in Objective-C:\n\n```objc\ntypedef NSInteger(^FuncInt2Int)(NSInteger);\ntypedef FuncInt2Int(^FuncInt2Int2Int)(NSInteger);\n\nFuncInt2Int2Int(^add)(NSInteger) = ^FuncInt2Int2Int(NSInteger a) {\n    return ^FuncInt2Int(NSInteger b) {\n        return ^NSInteger(NSInteger c) {\n            return a + b + c;\n        };\n    };\n};\n\nFuncInt2Int2Int addTwo = add(2);        // Int -> Int -> Int\nFuncInt2Int addFive = addTwo(3);        // Int -> Int\nNSInteger result = addFive(4);          // 9\n\nNSLog(@\"result = %ld\", result);         // result = 9\n```\n\nThe Swift version is minimal and elegant. But the Objective-C one has its charm, doesn’t it?\n",
