<p><em>tinyScientist</em> is officially six months old. I was browsing some of his early pictures and it’s crazy how much things have changed in such a short time. This week he tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsnip">Parsnip</a> and Potato. He loved the first, but didn’t enjoy the latter that much. Pumpkin is still this favorite.</p>
<p>Browsing <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/en-de">Disney+</a> I found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devs">Devs</a>, a Hulu TV Show I had no idea existed. It&rsquo;s an 8-episode miniseries about <em>free will</em> and <em>determinism</em> where <a href="https://nickofferman.co/">Nick Offerman</a> runs a tech company with quantum technology to&hellip; It doesn&rsquo;t matter, it&rsquo;s Nick Offerman. Interesting show, watched the entire thing.</p>
<p>Last week Bear <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bearapp/comments/11xlgxs/the_bear_2_beta_is_here/">released Bear 2 Beta on TestFlight</a> and, as a big Bear fan, I downloaded it to try. The editor was rebuilt from scratch, adding features users were asking for a long time. One of my favorite features is <em>backlinks</em>, something all <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> users know well. Currently Bear supports <code>[[WikiLinks]]</code>, allowing one to link another note (as Obsidian does), but the new version implements <em>backlinks</em>, showing which pages link the one selected. It also shows pages that mention the page but don&rsquo;t link them (<em>Unlinked Mention</em>). This is big! I exported all my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a> notes from Obsidian and imported on Bear and will use it for now on. And it&rsquo;s a native application, and I’m a sucker for good native applications.</p>
<p>I’m using <a href="https://arc.net/">Arc</a> from <a href="https://thebrowser.company/">The Browser Company</a> as default browser in my work computer for a few months, and I’m loving it. The way the tabs are managed, the different spaces, and profiles, the pinned tabs, etc… I’m the kind of person who can’t handle multiple tabs open at the same time, quickly getting lost in a see of tiny <em>favicons</em>. Arc changed that completely, I can easily keep several sites open simultaneously and, more importantly, find my way in it.</p>
<p>Thursday <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEE8GhLy6U4">Arc released Arc for iPhone</a>. It’s not a browser but a <em>bookmark</em> manager. It gives access to Spaces, Easel, and Notes one has on their computer. And offers the ability to create new tabs by importing URLs from other apps via the iOS’ share sheet. Still not sure how useful it is; time will tell.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>Most of the time I work from home, but if there&rsquo;s a day I like to go to the office, this day is Monday. It&rsquo;s the day I have most of my meetings (Retrospective, Planning, 1-on-1s), and it&rsquo;s the day the kitchen is restocked. Big day.</p>
<p>On Wednesday we had a public <a href="https://nordvpn.com/meshnet/">Meshnet</a> Meetup, open to the community where the team talked about the feature and technical details and concepts on networking and how the whole architecture was designed and built. My <a href="https://nordvpn.com/download/mac/">macOS team</a> works on Meshnet, and I’m happy to see the company promoting and talking about what we’re building openly. We even released <a href="https://github.com/NordSecurity/libtelio">some</a> of the <a href="https://github.com/NordSecurity/libdrop">libraries</a> as open source software. And, as in most meetups, tons of pizza and beer.</p>
<p>During March I experienced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-day_workweek">4-day workweeks</a>, but this week I had two days off, Thursday and Friday. Finally used all my vacation days from 2022.</p>
<h2 id="hacking">Hacking</h2>
<p>I finished the Now Pages support on my <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> app for macOS. The implementation allows the user to update their Now Pages and keeps a history of previous edits, in case the user wants to roll back a version.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Additionally, I&rsquo;ve added a way to share the Now Page as a Status in the Statuslog.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next week I plan to add the Webpage feature, so that users can edit their pages. Once that’s done, I will decide on how to release the application. I don’t know if Open Source or not, if AppStore or direct download (as <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> and <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a>). But I want to get it out before implementing the blog support, which will be a bit more complex.</p>
<h2 id="photography">Photography</h2>
<p>First year I managed to complete Micro.blog’s <a href="https://challenges.micro.blog/2023/02/28/march-photoblogging-challenge.html">March Photo Challenge</a>. I created a category and <a href="https://otavio.cc/categories/mbmar/">added all my photos there,</a>. These are my favorites:</p>

<p>I’m planning to write a blog post (or <a href="https://otavio.cc/kleingarten/">Digital Garden</a> entry) about <a href="https://obscura.camera/">Obscura 3</a>, the setup I have, and why it’s my favorite iPhone camera app.</p>

			 <p>Earlier this week I deleted another internet account: <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>.</p>
<p>We - <a href="https://nordsecurity.com/">Nord Security</a> - hosted the <strong>CocoaHead Berlin</strong> on Wednesday. It was great, full house, and we had too speakers from Nord Security. Bob from <a href="https://nordlocker.com/">NordLocker</a> talked about SwiftUI and Ieva from <a href="https://nordvpn.com/">NordVPN</a> about <a href="https://fastlane.tools/">fastlane</a>, screenshot automation and the iOS strategy to inject mock data for App Store screenshots.</p>
<p>Speaking of work, on Thursday I had a long training on Leadership (and Management) at the company. Earlier this year I got a new title/role, going from <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> to <strong>Engineering Team Lead</strong>, which means I’m half of the time Software Engineer and the other half Engineering Manager. It’s a brand new world to me, so I went back home exhausted. There’s a lot to process.</p>
<p>On Friday I had another day off, still taking 2022 vacation days before the end of March (German regulations, vacation days from a given year have to be spent before end of March of the following year). I took <em>tinyScientist</em> to a coffee shop around 9am, where <em>we</em> had coffee with a friend and talked about iOS and macOS development, leadership and management, and layoffs. <em>tinyScientist</em> got bored with all the talk and decided to take a nap in his <em>kinderwagen</em>.</p>
<p>In the previous weeks I finished two features of my <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> native client: <em>Statuslog</em> and <em>PURLs</em>, and during this week I started working on the <strong>Now Page</strong>. I still don’t know how I’m gonna distribute the app, if via AppStore, or directly for download as NetNewWire and Micro.blog do. Same goes for pricing, I still haven’t decided if it’ll be a paid app or not.</p>
<p>Finally, the most important thing which happened during the week: <em>tinyScientist</em> <strong>had his first <em>solid</em> meal</strong>. We were not expecting him to eat (we thought he would only play with the food), but he loved pumpkin. As result, he had pumpkin four days in a row for lunch.</p>

			 <p>On Tuesday I returned from a 10-day vacation, and on Friday I had another day off. In Germany there’s no carry over from one year to another, and the deadline to spend the vacation days from the previous year is end of March. As I still have vacation days from 2022 that I’m <em>forced</em> to take, I’m taking all the Fridays off until the end of the Month.</p>
<p>During the week we took <em>tinyScientist</em> to the doctor to do some extra tests he’ll for his surgery. We’re excited for him, but anxious as hell. I have faith in Science and in the doctors here. The support he’s getting from them is spectacular.</p>
<p>After months waiting for <em>tinyScientist</em>’s <a href="https://otavio.cc/child-benefits-in-germany/">Kindergeld</a>, it has finally arrived. Bureaucracy in Germany is a big thing, but at the end everything works as expected.</p>
<p>Last weekend I finished the modular architecture for my <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> client for macOS. The first feature I built while working in the architecture was the <em>Statuslog</em>. During the week, with just a few hours here and there I added <em>PURLs</em>. It’s a good indicator the modular architecture is a success. My goal was to achieve full decoupling in a way it should be easy to extend the application and add new features.</p>
<p>I started playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopath_Traveler_II">Octopath Traveler II</a>. The first game was amazing, and I ordered the second game as soon as they started selling it.</p>

The font is great and I asked <a href="https://web.getmatter.com/list/queue">Matter</a> to add it to their list of supported fonts.

<p>I keep going back-and-forth between Reminders and <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>. Every time there&rsquo;s a new macOS version I go back to Reminders to see what changed. But the truth is, Things is an amazing app and I decided to go back to it. The best of all, I can synchronize Things on all the computers I use, no matter if they’re using the same Apple ID or not. Reminders use iCloud, so I’m limited to the Apple ID I’m using. The downside is that I had to pay for Things twice.</p>
<p>Same goes for Safari and Firefox. I’m a big Firefox fan (since it was called Phoenix) and love the <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers">Multi-Account Containers</a> feature, but Safari is so much faster and has better support for physical keys and Apple Pay so I keep going back to it.</p>
<p>I read a review about <a href="https://readkit.app/">ReadKit</a> and decided to give it a try. I deleted Reeder from my devices to force myself to use it. The application is actually nice and I’m enjoying it a lot. I like the way it integrates with Pinboard as well, which is a service I use for about 15 years. It supports Smart Folders, a great feature when subscribing to tons of feeds.</p>
<p>Decided to create a <a href="https://otavio.cc/kleingarten/">mini Digital Garden</a> on Micro.blog. It&rsquo;s not perfect because I have to create all the links between pages manually. But at least all the content is hosted in my blog. I have to check if there&rsquo;s an API to post Pages on Micro.blog directly, and add an option to my <a href="https://otavio.cc/micropublish/">Micro.publish plugin</a> so that people can publish posts and pages from Obsidian. For now, the digital garden has notes about <a href="https://otavio.cc/unit-testing">Unit Testing</a>, <a href="https://otavio.cc/open-source">Open Source</a>, and <a href="https://otavio.cc/child-benefits-in-germany">Child Benefits in Germany</a>.</p>
<p>I released a minor change to <a href="https://otavio.cc/micropublish/">Micro.publish plugin</a>, including a link to my <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/otaviocc">Buy My a Coffee</a> page. I added a link to <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/otaviocc">Buy My a Coffee</a> in all my <a href="https://otavio.cc/kleingarten/">mini Digital Garden</a> pages as well.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re cat sitting for friends and I usually go to their house at night, after <em>tinyScientist</em> goes to bed. I&rsquo;m using my time there to work on my <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> native client for macOS and iOS. My client is fully modularized and each feature is a micro app on its own. Once all the setup is done, the app should scale pretty well, and adding new omg.lol features should be a breeze. I plan to write about <a href="https://otavio.cc/modularization/">Modularization</a> once the setup is finished.</p>
<p>I finally started playing <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/fire-emblem-engage-switch/">Fire Emblem Encore</a>, but already have my eyes on <strong>Metroid Prime Remastered</strong>. I must resist, in two weeks there’s <strong>Octopath Traveler II</strong> and in May, <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</strong>.</p>
<p>LEGO <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-minifigures-series-24-71037">Series 24</a> is complete. We went to a LEGO store and they had hundreds of minifigure bags. Spent a good amount of time there, <em>feeling</em> the bags and found the last two.</p>
<p>And finally, I had to use Twitter to talk to my ISP&rsquo;s support. Their service is too unstable and every now and then I have to contact them to complain (and ask for my money back). Maybe it&rsquo;s time to switch providers so that I don&rsquo;t have to use Twitter anymore.</p>

			 <p>Earlier this week I took my parents to the airport and had the opportunity to work on my side project on the train on my way back home. For some reason I enjoy coding on trains, buses, and airplanes. Especially when it’s raining outside. A wonderful combination of white noise sounds, I suppose.</p>
<p><em>tinyScientist</em> went to the doctor for his <em>U-Untersuchungen</em> and took some other vaccines. My wife has a Phd in vaccine development working with viruses, so of course <em>tinyScientist</em> won’t miss a single shot.</p>
<p>On Tuesday I returned to work after two weeks off and had my contract updated to match my new title: Engineering Team Lead. Never have I imagined I would take such kind of role, but the setup we have in the company works so well that I decided to accept the challenge. I’m glad I have the time to write code and lead a team.</p>
<p>Internet in Germany has its ups and downs; probably more downs than ups. This week my Internet Provider gave me money back because the service is too unstable in my area, I had to use my phone as personal hotspot in 30% of the meetings I attended.</p>
<p>Earlier this year LEGO released the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-minifigures-series-24-71037">Series 24</a> of its minifigures. We went to a store to <em>feel the packages</em>, as we always do, and found 10 minifigures. Still missing 2.</p>
<p>And finally, I canceled Audible. The local public library is great and offers thousands of audiobooks via <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby">Libby</a> for 10 EUR/year.</p>

			 <p>Obsidian is the <em>source of truth</em> for most of my writings<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and I though it would be interesting to post to <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> directly from it. In the past I explored several applications such as <a href="https://ulysses.app/">Ulysses</a>, <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>, and many others which allow publishing to Micro.blog, but they don&rsquo;t work for me, they don&rsquo;t reflect the way I think and take notes. Obsidian does.</p>
<p>So I searched on Micro.blog and found <a href="https://philbowell.me/2021/12/22/i-wonder-if.html">this post</a> from <a href="https://micro.blog/philbowell">@philbowell</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wonder if there is a way to post to Micro.blog from Obsidian. 🤔</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And nope, there isn&rsquo;t. So I took the challenge.</p>
<p>Obsidian isn&rsquo;t a native application and I can&rsquo;t remember when it was the last time I wrote something which isn&rsquo;t <em>compiled</em> to run on an specific architecture 👨‍💻, so I had to learn <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> and <code>npm</code>, and spent a good amount of time making <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> look pretty (stealing ideas from my friend <a href="https://atila.io/">Atila</a>).</p>
<p>Luckily for me, the TypeScript syntax isn&rsquo;t that different from Swift, so in a matter of hours I had something working. Since the Obsidian Plugin architecture is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a>, I decided to go with OOP using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel">MVVM</a>, without third-party dependencies to avoid taking unnecessary complexity into Obsidian.</p>
<p>The result of all this is <a href="https://github.com/otaviocc/obsidian-microblog">Micro.publish</a>, my Obsidian plugin to publish to Micro.blog. The plugin isn&rsquo;t available to install from Obsidian&rsquo;s <em>Community Plugins</em> yet since they review all the plugins there, but it&rsquo;s possible to install it directly from GitHub by following some manual steps.</p>
<p>Micro.publish has the features I need. It allows</p>
<ul>
<li>setting default tags</li>
<li>setting the default post visibility</li>
<li>setting a default blog (for those with more than one M.b blog)</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And before publishing, it&rsquo;s possible to override these default settings for the post being published.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>More features are planned, and will be coming soon.</p>

			 <p>First version of my <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> plugin for <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is ready 👨‍💻 Some feature are missing - as expected for a first release -, but I plan to add them in the future. E.g.,</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog selection</li>
<li>Set categories/tags</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently it allows users to</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the default post visibility for new posts</li>
<li>Set the post title</li>
<li>Open post, preview, and edit URLs after publishing the post</li>
</ul>
<p>The plugin can be found on <a href="https://github.com/otaviocc/obsidian-microblog">GitHub</a>. The next step is to submit it to Obsidian&rsquo;s <em>Community Plugins</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: The name isn&rsquo;t final since this is not an official Micro.blog product. I have to find a better name for it.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago I decided to get my leather tools in the cellar and make something. Since I have more than one pouch - a small one, and a bigger when I&rsquo;m carrying my Fuji - I decided to make something to put my pocket notebooks - which I also make -, cards, pocket knife, and flashlight. This way it&rsquo;s easier to move all my EDC from one pouch to another.</p>
<p>Leather work is fun, and for me it works for medidation or to listen to podcasts I need to focus on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the final result. Below the pocket knife and flashlight.</p>

			 <p>📷 Yesterday I decided to experiment with different film simulations. I like the ideia of JPEG photos straight out of camera (SOOC) since they make you think more before shooting and embrace the errors you would get with a film camera. I turned RAW off and never went back.</p>

			 <p>About a month ago I decided to build a new app to attend a personal need, a desktop client for <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>, a service I&rsquo;ve been using for over a decade to store and manage my bookmarks.</p>
<p>As any application which requires internet to fetch and update data, my client needed a way to detect network accessibility. For a long time the strategy adopted by engineers in this situation was to rely on Apple&rsquo;s Reachability class, a sample code the company used to provide for download on their developer portal. Well, either that or one of the many CocoaPods frameworks the community built to replace Apple&rsquo;s drag-and-drop solution. But since iOS 12.0 and macOS 10.14 there&rsquo;s a powerfull first-party alternative.</p>
<p>Introduced a couple of years ago, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpathmonitor"><code>NWPathMonitor</code></a> is the easiest way to detect network changes (and retrieve connection properties). Its interface is extremely simple to use, providing a callback to get notified of updates.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>So I looked for a similar example in Apple&rsquo;s frameworks, one which requires a method to be called to trigger the action. Turns out <code>URLSession</code>, familiar to every iOS/macOS engineer, is the perfect example since it requires <code>URLSession.resume()</code> to be called to fire the network requrest. Recently <code>URLSession</code> got a new method, a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/3329707-datataskpublisher">publisher</a> which starts the request at the moment there&rsquo;s demand (a subscriber):</p>

</code></pre></div><p>And that&rsquo;s the interface I wanted for my monitor. A simple publisher which starts <em>emitting values</em> as soon as there&rsquo;s demand.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>SwiftUI and Combine are new to me, I spiked and re-implemented some UI components I have up in my sleeve, but nothing too complex. Building this client is helping me to explore and learn new APIs.</p>
<p>The protocols <code>Publisher</code>, <code>Subscriber</code>, and <code>Subscription</code> are examples of these APIs. To implement a custom publisher it&rsquo;s necessary to implement types conforming to two of these protocols.</p>
<p>First, a quick recap:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher"><code>Publisher</code></a> is the type which emits events over time,</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber/"><code>Subscriber</code></a> is the type which receives events published by the publisher, and</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscription"><code>Subscription</code></a> implements the link between publishers and subscribers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step was to define my publisher interface. Since the monitor requires a queue to run, I decided to pass the queue as argument. In order to simplify its interface, a background queue is passed by default to the implementation.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span style="color:#a90d91">extension</span> <span style="color:#3f6e75">NWPathMonitor</span> {

}
</code></pre></div><p>The interface provides a hint of the first type to be implemented, <code>NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher</code>. Most of the code is boilerplate, and for this publisher, the <code>Output</code> expected is <code>NWPath</code>, without a <code>Failure</code>.</p>
<p>When the publisher <em>receives</em> a subscriber, the link between them is established.</p>

			 <p>I strongly believe that the best way to learn something new is by experimenting and practicing it.</p>
<p>A few months ago I was studying <em>Functional Programming in Swift</em>. Swift is a modern, powerful, and safe language. Its syntax is so simple and elegante that it works as an invitation to dive into the Functional Programming world.</p>
<p>After practicing Functional Programming in Swift for a few weeks, I decided to try something a little bit different. I decided it was time to experiment with <em>curried functions</em>, <em>map</em>, <em>filter</em>, <em>sort</em>, and <em>reduce</em> in Objective-C.</p>
<p>Swift collections implement <em>map</em>, <em>sort</em>, <em>filter</em>, and <em>reduce</em>, so the first step on my experiment was to reimplement these in a <code>NSArray</code> category, trying to match the method signature that Swift implements.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Map</strong>: given a <em>transform operation</em>, it returns a new <code>NSArray</code> where all its elements are transformed according to the operation. The <em>transform operation</em> takes an object and returns another object (that might be of a different type of the original object).</li>
<li><strong>Filter</strong>: given a <em>condition operation</em>, it returns a new <code>NSArray</code> where all its elements satisfy the condition. The <em>condition operation</em> takes an object and returns a boolean.</li>
<li><strong>Sort</strong>: given a <em>sort condition</em>, it returns a new <code>NSArray</code> where all its elements are sorted according to the condition. The <em>sort condition</em> takes two objects and returns a boolean.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce</strong>: given a <em>combine operation</em>, it returns a recombined object by recursively processing its constituent parts. The <em>combine operation</em> takes the initial state and an object and returns a recombined object which is of the same type of the initial state.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>NSArray</code> category ended up with the following interface:</p>
