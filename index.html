			 <p>I found a great printer on Saturday and bought. It&rsquo;s an <a href="https://epson.com/ecotank-home-office-printers">Epson EcoTank</a>, which operates using ink tanks instead of traditional ink cartridges. Although the printer is pricier than standard inkjet printers, it is completely worth the investment. Ah, and it has fax&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a new TV series on Apple TV, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation_(TV_series)">Constellation</a>. It&rsquo;s great, and I binge-watched all the available episodes so far. By around episode four, the plot became somewhat predictable, so I&rsquo;m really hoping for more twists.</p>
<p>About two weeks ago, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iconfactory/project-tapestry/creator_bio">The Iconfactory</a> reached their funding goal on Kickstarter for their new initiative, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iconfactory/project-tapestry">Project Tapestry</a>. It was the first Kickstarter project I ever backed. This week, I pledged to another project, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shawntomkin/sundered-isles-expansion-for-ironsworn-starforged">Sundered Isles</a>, an expansion for <a href="https://www.ironswornrpg.com/product-ironsworn-starforged">Ironsworn: Starforged</a>. I&rsquo;ve always been interested in playing Ironsworn: Starforged, but the physical books were out of stock. The Kickstarter campaign offers a tier with a special price that includes both the original content and the expansion. Impressively, the project reached 600% of its initial funding goal overnight.</p>

			 <p>Apple released its Journal app just a couple of weeks before my subscription to <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a> was set to expire. Opting not to renew it, I decided to give Apple’s Journal a try, thinking it might meet my needs. And perhaps it does, but its limitation to being only an iPhone app makes it impractical for my use.</p>
<p>Consequently, I&rsquo;ve found myself using pocket notebooks more and more — this <em>transition</em> wasn&rsquo;t intentional. By the time I noticed, the Field Notes notebook I always carry with me was nearly full.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://birchtree.me/author/matt/">Matt Birchler</a> recently shared an insightful article titled <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/the-browser-company-feels-gross-to-me-right-now/">&ldquo;The Browser Company Feels Gross To Me Right Now&rdquo;</a>, in which he mentions <a href="https://club.macstories.net/posts/macstories-weekly-issue-408">MacStories Weekly 408</a> — which I can&rsquo;t read because I&rsquo;m not a subscriber.</p>
<p>In his blog post, Matt describes exactly how I currently feel about Arc. I used Arc for a long time on both my personal and professional devices. While I <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/10/14/week.html">switched back to Safari on my personal device several months ago</a>, I continued to use Arc on my work device for one primary reason: its superior tab management. Dealing with a constant stream of links throughout the day, Arc has been invaluable in managing this flood of information.</p>
<p>However, I have recently begun transitioning to Firefox for work purposes, as Safari does not seem to effectively manage the volume of tabs I open throughout the day.</p>

			 <p>My printer died a <a href="https://otavio.cc/2024/02/17/090000.html">few weeks ago</a>, but I needed to double-check to be certain. Now it&rsquo;s confirmed: it has become a useless piece of hardware. Although the printer itself is actually fully functional, it requires both color and black ink cartridges to operate, which Canon has discontinued for my model. This situation is absurd, the hardware is still in working condition. Currently, I&rsquo;m in the market for a new printer, but the selection process is overwhelming due to the vast array of brands, models, and types. I&rsquo;m considering a model that uses ink from tanks instead of cartridges.</p>
<p>ICRPG is an incredible system, and I have the <a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/366519/Index-Card-RPG-Master-Edition">Master Edition from DriveThruRPG</a>, featuring regular paper, black and white print, and a softcover. However, this week, I received my copy of the Collector&rsquo;s Edition, and it&rsquo;s outstanding. The quality of the paper, the hardcover, and the color printing are all exceptional.</p>
<p>I recently released <a href="https://micropublish.blog/2024/03/04/micropublish.html">Micro.publish 2.5.0</a>, which now stores titles and tags/categories within a note and allows users to edit tags/categories when updating a post. Since Obsidian is not a database, storing information directly in the note is necessary to facilitate the editing of posts or pages. This feature simplifies post updates and later edits through Obsidian.</p>
<p><em>tinyScientist</em> is fascinated with the moon, constantly searching the sky for it, whether it&rsquo;s day or night. While the sun also captures his attention, it doesn&rsquo;t compare to his interest in the moon (or airplanes).</p>
<p><em>tinyScientist</em> has started spending more time at kindergarten, now including lunchtime in his routine. It&rsquo;s astonishing to realize he already has his own routines and social life, likely interacting with more people daily than I do.</p>
<p>I had Thursday and Friday off (vacation and a bank holiday). On Thursday, <em>scientist</em> and I dropped <em>tinyScientist</em> off at kindergarten and then had breakfast together at a nearby coffee shop. It was our first breakfast alone since <em>tinyScientist</em> was born, which felt <em>weird</em>.</p>
<p><em>scientist</em> and I <em>hacked</em> an IKEA BILLY Bookcase into a desk since she didn’t have one after we turned our home office into <em>tinyScientist</em>&rsquo;s bedroom. The result is excellent, offering plenty of space for books and stationery. I must admit I&rsquo;m a bit jealous; I wish I had a similar desk with ample space for my items.</p>
<p>I ran out of prompts for the <a href="https://epictalestavern.com/">Epic Tales Tavern</a> and had to create 100 more. However, I&rsquo;m not entirely satisfied with the new prompts and may revise some of them later. One of my favorite creations this week is this <a href="https://epictalestavern.com/2024/03/03/even-the-undying.html">Lich making coffee</a>; the coffee machine&rsquo;s design exceeded my expectations.</p>
<p>And finally… I spent Friday at home, battling a fever. It felt like my brain just refused to engage in anything demanding, so I found comfort on silly videos online.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve heard there&rsquo;s a concept known as <em>Week</em>, which spans seven days. Somehow, mine seemed to disappear before I even realized it. By the time I paused to reflect, it felt as though the week had already slipped away.</p>
<p>However, I did manage to finish watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/See_(TV_series)">See</a>. People have mixed feelings about the show, but I found it quite captivating. I was intrigued by its premise, which imagines a civilization that has regressed to a state reminiscent of the Vikings<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, 500 years into the future, following a virus that nearly eradicated humanity (with only 0.03% surviving) and left the survivors without their sense of sight.</p>
<p>Watching the show feels like watching an RPG session unfold. It features a diverse cast of <em>characters</em>, each belonging to different <em>classes</em> and possessing unique <em>abilities</em>, who collaborate on <em>quests</em>.</p>
<p>There are numerous books and shows that explore dystopian futures, yet there&rsquo;s something uniquely compelling about See that I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s the allure of a Viking-like future civilization that worships the Sun as the <em>Godflame</em>, or the profound loss of today&rsquo;s knowledge to the extent that metal and concrete are believed to be divine creations. But there&rsquo;s something there&hellip;</p>
<p>The series&rsquo; setting offers immense potential for new stories and characters. Inspired by this, I&rsquo;m considering running a one-shot solo RPG session to explore this universe further.</p>
<p>Speaking of RPG, <em>scientist</em> asked me to buy a D20 for her.</p>
<p>In other news, <em>tinyScientist</em> is enjoying kindergarten, and we&rsquo;re delighted to see him so happy there.</p>
<p>Ah, and I&rsquo;m giving <a href="https://getmatter.com">Matter</a> another try. As a Patron, I have a &ldquo;subscription&rdquo; which lasts for years, and it would be silly of me not to use it.

			 <p><strong>Image Upload</strong> is likely the feature I am asked about most frequently. Although there are no API limitations on the part of <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> or <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>, implementing this feature requires design decisions that may not make everyone happy. By &ldquo;design&rdquo; here I refer not to the user interface, but the whole process of defining the architecture, components, data, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>To elaborate, in Obsidian, images are stored as files in the file system and are inserted into notes using Markdown syntax.</p>
<p>The most straightforward solution for uploading images would be to identify all images in the note, upload them, and then replace the Markdown reference to the local file with a link to the uploaded image when publishing the post.</p>
<p>Simple, isn&rsquo;t it? However, a complication arises when the user decides to edit the note and update the post. In this scenario, the images would be re-uploaded.</p>
<p>To prevent images from being re-uploaded, one solution is to replace (and save) the Markdown image file reference with a reference to the already uploaded image after the initial upload.</p>
<p>This approach ensures that when the post is resubmitted, there is no need to re-upload the image.</p>
<p>Yet, this introduces another issue: notes would now reference a remote image rather than a local one in the Vault, rendering them inaccessible for viewing or editing offline since the images won&rsquo;t appear.</p>
<p>Is there a solution? Certainly, there&rsquo;s always a way.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s reconsider the process from the beginning. When attempting to publish a note with images, we could take the <em>fingerprint</em> of each image and upload it to Micro.blog, while keeping the original Markdown reference to the local file in Obsidian.</p>
<p>During post editing, we would check if the post contains images and match their <em>fingerprints</em> against those of previously uploaded images. If there&rsquo;s a match, we replace the reference with the one already uploaded; if not, we upload the new image and proceed similarly.</p>
<p>The challenge here is that Obsidian is a text editor, not a database, and maintaining <em>fingerprints</em> and references to images has a cost.</p>
<p>Hence, the question arises: where should this information be stored? There are two potential options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Within the note itself, using YAML/Properties. However, some users might find it unappealing to have this information visible as a property.</li>
<li>In a separate file in the file system, hidden from users. This is similar to what Micro.publish already does for storing blog lists and categories.</li>
</ol>
<p>Storing the information in the note might detract from its aesthetics for some users. On the other hand, while technically feasible, storing it in a separate file is something I would prefer to avoid. I prefer to use the file system for general user account or blog-related information (like default blog settings and category lists) rather than specific post information. For note-specific details, I prefer to include them within the note itself to enhance portability (like I already do for the post title and categories/tags).</p>
<p>Thus, the current dilemma is finding a technical solution that maintains Obsidian&rsquo;s usability (keeping image file references in posts for offline access) and avoids re-uploading previously uploaded images.</p>
<p>Time is limited, but this is the next big feature I want to add to Micro.publish.</p>

			 <p>After posting last week&rsquo;s notes on Saturday morning, DHL delivered my Index Card RPG Decks right to my door. However, it was a busy weekend, and I didn’t have much time to explore them.</p>
<p>During the week, I revisited the local RPG shop where I had purchased <a href="https://morkborg.com/">Mörk Borg</a> <a href="https://otavio.cc/2024/02/17/090000.html">the previous week</a> to buy a book for <em>scientists</em>, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/exaltedfuneral/herbalists-primer">Herbalist&rsquo;s Primer</a>. To my delight, the store not only had the book but also the Herbalist&rsquo;s Primer deck of flash cards!</p>
<p>The staff at <em>tinyScientist</em>&rsquo;s kindergarten had internal training sessions on Thursday and Friday, resulting in no classes. Since I still have vacation days to take before the end of March, I took the opportunity to take Thursday and Friday off as well.</p>
<p>The weather on Thursday didn’t help much, so we stayed home during the day. In the evening, I attended a friend&rsquo;s anniversary party.</p>
<p>On Friday, <em>scientist</em> and I took <em>tinyScientist</em> to the zoo. He was thrilled! He enjoys walking and spent most of our visit on his feet. During this visit, he spent a considerable amount of time observing the <a href="https://otavio.cc/2024/02/20/tinyscientist-has-a.html">winwins</a>.</p>

			 <p>It was a busy week, and I continued playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia%3A_The_Lost_Crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> in a healthy manner. The same approach goes to the TV show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/See_(TV_series)">See</a>, which I have been watching in a balanced way.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, <em>tinyScientist</em> took part in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_in_Germany%2C_Switzerland_and_Austria"><em>Fasching</em></a> at the kindergarten, dressed as Batman! He was the most handsome Batman ever<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, <em>tinyScientist</em> woke up grumpy and feeling unwell, and we decided not to send him to kindergarten. It turned out to be a wise decision as his condition worsened throughout the day. The night was particularly rough, leading to him also missing kindergarten on Thursday, following the doctor&rsquo;s advice.</p>
<p>Also, on Wednesday, I received my copy of <a href="https://www.runehammer.online/online-store/Viking-Death-Squad-p613143665">Viking Death Squad</a>. By Thursday, I got <a href="https://www.runehammer.online/online-store/ICRPG-Hard-Suit-PDF-p495682013">Index Card RPG: Hard Suit</a>, and I am still awaiting the official Index Card RPG Decks.</p>
<p>I took Friday off, as I still have a few vacation days that need to be spent before the end of March – the deadline in Germany to avoid losing the previous year&rsquo;s vacation days. I spent the time working on <a href="https://micropublish.blog">Micro.publish</a> and&hellip; purchasing another RPG book from a local store, <a href="https://morkborg.com">MÖRK BORG</a>. The book itself is a masterpiece of art.</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t planned to start watching another TV show, but on Saturday night, while organizing my desk, I decided to find something to watch. I ended up watching the first episode of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/See_(TV_series)">See</a>. The concept intrigued me, and I watched the entire episode. However, I won&rsquo;t binge-watch the series; instead, I&rsquo;ll watch an episode now and then, in a balanced manner.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with the <a href="https://www.runehammer.online/online-store/Index-Card-RPG-Collectors-Edition-p613134553">Index Card RPG</a> system - ICRPG for short - and <a href="https://otavio.cc/2024/02/06/the-art-of.html">created a custom GPT</a> to generate some images for me. The custom GPT isn&rsquo;t perfect, but I&rsquo;m satisfied with the results it produces.</p>
<p>Below is an image of an Orc with his fluffy cat, a rendition of the <a href="https://epictalestavern.com/2023/12/10/this-orc-champion.html">image I created for my other blog</a>, Epic Tales Tavern.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>tinyScientist</em> is very happy with kindergarten, and so are we. The <em>Kita-Eingewöhnung</em> was a success, and by the end of the week, he was staying there alone without <em>scientist</em> needing to be there.</p>
<p>Another milestone is that <em>tinyScientist</em> wants to walk and run everywhere. He walks very comfortably, and we hardly notice any effort on his part to maintain balance. Very natural.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, I stopped using Instapaper and have since abandoned Pocket, Readwise, Matter, Pinboard, and other similar services for saving links to read later. However, I&rsquo;m starting to miss the functionality, as I encounter several pages during work hours that I would like to save for later reading. On my work computer, I use a different Apple ID, preventing me from syncing <a href="https://goodlinks.app">GoodLinks</a> via iCloud between my work and personal computers. I&rsquo;m considering using Micro.blog&rsquo;s Bookmarks feature for this purpose. Nonetheless, for reading later, I continue to use <a href="https://goodlinks.app">GoodLinks</a> on my personal devices. It&rsquo;s an excellent app.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve added a new microhook to Matt&rsquo;s Tiny Theme and submitted a pull request, which <a href="https://mattlangford.com/2024/02/06/icymi-tiny-theme.html">was accepted</a> and is now available to all. The new microhook enables users to configure the profile image displayed at the top of the blog/page. <a href="https://otavio.cc/2024/02/04/color-coding-my.html">I&rsquo;m using it on my three sites</a> (two blogs and one single-page website).</p>
<p>One of the sites I host on <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> is the <a href="https://micropublish.blog">Micro.publish</a> website, which <a href="https://otavio.cc/2024/02/05/micropublish-address-just.html">recently moved to a new address</a>.</p>
<p>Regarding <a href="https://micropublish.blog">Micro.publish</a>, I&rsquo;m planning a release soon that will allow users to edit categories of previously published posts. Currently, only the title and content of the posts can be updated.</p>
<p>Following that, I plan to start working on the image uploader. I wrote a detailed draft outlining some design decisions and other considerations about Obsidian and the solution, which I plan to publish soon.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>I had planned to work from the office on Monday or Tuesday. However, due to rain and wind, I ended up going to the office only on Friday. Fortunately, Friday turned out to be a good day to be there, as I had several one-on-one meetings and a demo session.</p>
<p>The only <em>problem</em> with going to the office is its proximity to the city&rsquo;s largest art supply store. It&rsquo;s hard to resist temptation there.</p>

			 <p>Today, I started using <a href="https://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a> Actions, a feature that allows users to automatically organize their articles — such as marking them as read, starring them, or sending notifications — based on specific criteria they set.</p>
<p>I’m using it to automatically mark articles as read if they match one of the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>title:&quot;members post&quot;</code>: At least one of the feeds I follow publishes posts exclusive to members, to which I’m not subscribed.</li>
<li><code>title.exact:(&quot;Sponsor:&quot; OR &quot;(Sponsor)&quot;)</code>: Three other feeds label posts about their sponsors with “Sponsor:” or “(Sponsor)”.</li>
<li><code>title.exact:&quot;Apple Vision Pro&quot;</code>: There has been excessive coverage about Apple’s new hardware recently.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two actions were enabled for all feeds to simplify the process. The final filter is applied to all feeds with exception of a group of feeds that contains news and posts about software engineering.</p>

			 <p>On Sunday, I dedicated some time to creating a website for <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.publish</a> using <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>&rsquo;s new feature, the <a href="https://news.micro.blog/2024/01/25/added-a-new.html">Single-Site Web Site</a>.</p>
<p>I opted for a variation of the <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog/theme-bear">Bear theme</a> for the site. However, later in the week, <a href="https://mattlangford.com">Matt</a> released the <a href="https://mattlangford.com/2024/02/02/new-tiny-theme.html">Tiny Theme 2.0</a>, introducing a feature that significantly simplifies customizations. As a result, I decided to use it for the website.</p>
<p><em>tinyScientist</em> had two doctor&rsquo;s appointments this week. For the first one, <em>scientist</em> accompanied him to the hospital for a routine check-up with the doctor who had performed his surgery <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/12/09/week.html">in December</a>. Everything went well, and the next appointment is scheduled for three months from now. I joined them for the second appointment, which was for vaccination and a regular medical check-up with the pediatrician. All was well there too!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already played more than 50% of the new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-switch/">Prince of Persia</a>. I’m trying to spread out my gameplay to avoid finishing it all at once; let’s see if I can maintain that self-control.</p>
<p>Towards the week&rsquo;s end, I was visited by a cold that decided to linger. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s just a cold and not the flu.</p>

			 <p>I can&rsquo;t believe January is almost over. I managed to survive an entire month without subscribing to a new service or buying a new app. However, I did spend money on books, including literature and RPGs.</p>
<p>I finished watching the seasons of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch:_Legacy_of_Monsters">Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</a> - I would watch another season.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_All_Mankind_(TV_series)">For All Mankind</a> - I&rsquo;m eager for more!</li>
</ul>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t start watching anything new. I&rsquo;m going to spend some time now reading and playing RPGs instead.</p>
<p>I worked from the office on Tuesday and Wednesday and attended two in-person workshops. On Tuesday, the workshop was about <strong>Creativity</strong> and, on the following day, about <strong>Time Management and Productivity</strong>. Both were filled with theory, techniques, and practical exercises. I hope I can apply some of these techniques, especially those for time management.</p>
<p>On Friday, I had to make a quick visit to the Embassy to get <em>tinyScientist</em>&rsquo;s new passport and social security number. As with all visits to the Embassy, it was quick and easy.</p>
<p>In other news, <em>tinyScientist</em>&rsquo;s <em>Kita-Eingewöhnung</em> is going pretty well. It&rsquo;s great to see the progress and how well <em>tinyScientist</em> is adapting to the new environment.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I&rsquo;ve started playing <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-switch/">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> on the Nintendo Switch. I wasn&rsquo;t planning on buying it — who am I kidding? — but I ended up purchasing the game on Friday. At the time of this writing, I&rsquo;ve already played 30% of the game. It&rsquo;s that good!</p>

			 <p>This week I traveled to Lithuania for several work-related activities, which included one-on-one sessions, management meetings, and the eagerly anticipated presentation of our Q4 results.</p>
<p>Due to a lack of direct flights, I first flew to Latvia, spending a brief four hours there before continuing on to Lithuania. During this time, I had the opportunity to meet some colleagues from the company (from other teams or departments) and we spent those four hours chatting.</p>
<p>The core of my week in Lithuania was filled with enriching professional experiences. I participated in several one-on-one sessions, providing ample opportunity for in-depth discussions and personal connections with my colleagues. Additionally, I attended meetings with my managers to discuss ongoing projects and plan for the future.</p>
<p>A highlight of the week was the presentation of our Q4 results. It was gratifying to see the fruits of our teams&rsquo; hard work and to gain insights into our company&rsquo;s trajectory. Furthermore, during the OKR presentation, the return of <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/04/18/week.html">workations</a> was announced, complete with dates and a destination.</p>
<p>Receiving my annual feedback from my manager was a significant moment for me. This is always a time for reflection and growth, and I appreciated the constructive insights and encouragement I received.</p>
<p>A substantial part of my trip was dedicated to the NordVPN macOS Team Workshop. This workshop was particularly relevant and enriching, providing an excellent platform for learning and sharing experiences.</p>
<p>The week also included a delightful dinner with the entire NordVPN Apple Team. It was a wonderful opportunity to unwind and bond with my colleagues in a more relaxed setting, enhancing our team dynamics.</p>
<p>On my way back to Germany, I had a brief 30-minute layover in Latvia. I arrived back home on Saturday morning, with my first flight at 5:30 AM. This early return was intentional, as I wanted to ensure that I had the weekend to spend at home with <em>scientist</em> and <em>tinyScientist</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, I didn&rsquo;t miss the opportunity to create some images for my other blog, <a href="https://epictalestavern.com/">Epic Tales Tavern</a>, inspired by the week&rsquo;s events:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://epictalestavern.com/2024/01/09/meet-the-bravest.html">Jan 9, 2024</a>: 🌒💈 Meet the bravest barber in the realm, daring to give a haircut to none other than a formidable Werewolf!</li>

</ul>
<p>Reflecting on this week, I am filled with gratitude for the experiences and the opportunity to connect with my team in person. These moments of face-to-face interaction are invaluable, providing a depth of connection that is difficult to replicate remotely.</p>
<p>As I settle back into my routine, I am energized and inspired to apply the insights and ideas gathered during my trip. It was a week of learning, growth, and meaningful connections that I will cherish and build upon in my professional journey.</p>

			 <p>I took two flights this morning. On both, I fell asleep before the planes took off and woke up after they landed. I didn&rsquo;t feel anything during the landings. This reminds me of the Napa earthquake years ago, which I didn&rsquo;t see/feel because I was sleeping. It&rsquo;s super difficult to wake me up.</p>

			 <p>The new year arrives, but not much really changes. In Brazil, the school calendar aligns with the calendar year, meaning a new year signals a new grade. As a child, the New Year would bring new things, stories, and experiences. However, as an adult, the New Year doesn’t bring significant changes. Mostly, it’s about remembering to write 2024 instead of 2023 on forms. And do taxes again.</p>
<p>Too melancholic or reflective? Let’s try again.</p>
<p>The year began with us waking up <em>tinyScientist</em> to watch the fireworks. We were uncertain about waking him, but two minutes before midnight, I decided to do so, and I’m glad we did. He was amazed by the fireworks, repeatedly expressing “wow” as he watched them. Fortunately, our windows, well-prepared for winter, insulated the sound, ensuring he wasn’t scared by the noise. Fifteen minutes later, he was back in bed, sound asleep.</p>
<p>I’ve started watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch:_Legacy_of_Monsters">Monarch</a>. Time was limited this week, so I only managed to watch two episodes, but what I’ve seen so far has been enjoyable. I&rsquo;m looking forward to watching the rest of the first season.</p>
<p>I released a few updates for <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.publish</a> (three, to be exact). <a href="https://otavio.cc/2024/01/01/micropublish.html">Two</a> of <a href="https://otavio.cc/2024/01/02/microblog-news-fixed.html">these</a> updates are primarily implementation details that won’t affect 99% of users. However, for the 1% who publish lengthy posts or pages, these updates should improve stability. The <a href="https://otavio.cc/2024/01/05/micropublish.html">third update</a> modifies how categories are synchronized. Previously, only the categories of the “default” blog were synchronized. With the new update, users will now experience automatic synchronization of categories across all their blogs. Other changes are detailed in the <a href="https://otavio.cc/2024/01/05/micropublish.html">blog post</a> I published yesterday.</p>
<p><em>Scientist</em>’s niece is visiting and staying with us. Since I’m back from vacation, I’m not able to join them for all the tourist activities.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-eu/products/mice/mx-master-3s-mac-bluetooth-mouse.910-006572.html">Logitech MX Master 3S for Mac</a> met an untimely end, having drowned in coffee.</p>
<p>Happy New Year 🎉</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m excited to announce that a new version of <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.publish</a> is rolling out today. This update brings several significant changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Automatic Synchronization of Categories Across All Blogs</strong>: Users with multiple blogs on <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> will now experience automatic synchronization of categories across all their blogs. Previously, only the categories of the &ldquo;default&rdquo; blog were synchronized. This enhancement ensures a more unified and efficient user experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refined Category Suggestion Picker</strong>: The category suggestion picker has been improved. It now displays only the categories relevant to the currently selected blog. This change makes the process of categorizing posts more intuitive and tailored to each specific blog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Control Over Automatic Synchronization in Obsidian</strong>: Users now have the option to decide whether categories should automatically synchronize when opening Obsidian. This feature adds flexibility, catering to diverse user preferences.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The introduction of these features means that Micro.publish will now make more network requests. For instance, a user with three blogs will require three network requests to retrieve the categories. To accommodate users who prefer to limit these requests, I have introduced a new toggle in the plugin settings. This toggle allows users to opt out of automatic category fetching when Obsidian opens. By default, the feature is enabled to cater to the majority of our users who maintain a single blog.</p>
<p>For those who opt out of the automatic synchronization feature, manual synchronization is still possible. Users can easily synchronize categories using the command <em>Micro.publish: Synchronize Categories</em> in the Command Palette.</p>

<p>PS: I&rsquo;m not sure why <a href="https://cleanshot.com/">CleanShot X</a> didn&rsquo;t capture Obsidian&rsquo;s dropdown menu.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m releasing <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.publish</a> 2.3.3 today. This version introduces a change in the way new pages are published, using the Micropub JSON implementation. The previous version, 2.3.2, brought similar changes for posts.</p>
<p>Should you face any oddities, please let me know. However, I anticipate that the publishing and editing of both posts and pages, especially those that are <em>very very</em> long, will now be more reliable.</p>

			 <p>A few weeks ago, <a href="https://social.lol/@esamecar">Marco</a> reached out to me via Mastodon, reporting an issue with <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.publish</a>. For some reason, one of his posts failed to publish, returning an error message &ldquo;Failed to Fetch.&rdquo; Initially, I suspected it could be related to his <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> App Token. I suggested that he refresh the blog list and update the categories to see what would happen. These actions worked fine. He also managed to update the post using Micro.publish; only the publishing process was failing.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the same issue occurred again for Marco – a &ldquo;Failed to Fetch&rdquo; error when posting <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/31/what-caught-my.html">his weekly notes</a>. This time, I asked Marco to send me the raw markdown file he was trying to post, allowing me to reproduce the issue from my end.</p>
<p>Reproducing the problem was straightforward. A check on the <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> Console revealed that the network request was rejected due to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS restrictions</a>.</p>
<p>A search on the Obsidian Forum led me to discover that Obsidian has an <a href="https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/blob/c01fc3074deeb3dfc6ee02546d113b448735b294/obsidian.d.ts#L2635">alternative method for network requests</a> that bypasses CORS restrictions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, switching my network client to use Obsidian&rsquo;s <code>requestUrl()</code> method didn&rsquo;t solve the problem as I had hoped, but it did pinpoint the issue: the network request&rsquo;s URI was excessively long, causing an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/414">HTTP Error 414</a>.</p>
<p>This revelation made sense. The original implementation used Micropub&rsquo;s classic API, which includes all parameters as query items in the request&rsquo;s URL for new posts.</p>
<p>For updating posts, in my Micro.publish, I use a JSON payload instead of query items, as this is Micropub&rsquo;s method for handling updates. Given that Micropub also provides a JSON option for publishing new posts, I decided to use that.</p>
<p>Now, both posting and updating posts utilize a JSON payload instead of query items.</p>
<p>For reference, here is the definition for new posts:</p>

			 <h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>The week began on Sunday with a lunch at the <a href="https://www.hardrockcafe.com">Hard Rock Cafe</a>, honoring my godson&rsquo;s 6th birthday at his favorite spot. My son, <em>tinyScientist</em>, also seemed to favor this place, enthusiastically enjoying his meal and even <em>stealing</em> some of his godmother&rsquo;s fries.</p>
<p>Following lunch, we went to their home for a <em>Gamer</em>-themed birthday celebration. We spent the rest of the day building LEGOs and playing <a href="https://supermariobroswonder.nintendo.com">Super Mario Wonders</a>.</p>
<p>On December 25th, <em>tinyScientist</em> woke up to a number of gifts from Santa, a reward for an exceptional year. Unfortunately we couldn&rsquo;t attend the <a href="https://nordvpn.com">company</a> party, where Santa had a heartfelt message ready for him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been incredibly strong, facing two major surgeries this year. Your courage and resilience have been astounding. Your parents are not only proud but also deeply inspired by you, their little hero, who brings immense joy and pride into their lives.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the same day, <em>tinyScientist</em> toke his first steps! His vocabulary is also growing; he now calls Siri, mimicking her &ldquo;uh huh&rdquo; responses in a playful exchange.</p>
<h2 id="apps-and-services">Apps and Services</h2>
<p>With Instapaper&rsquo;s increased pricing, I searched for alternatives. Being deeply ingrained in Apple&rsquo;s ecosystem, I decided to give <a href="https://goodlinks.app">GoodLinks</a> another try.</p>
<p>GoodLinks meets my requirements. A review of my reading habits showed that while I often highlight articles, I rarely revisit these highlights (OK, that doesn&rsquo;t apply to books). GoodLinks provides a no-subscription, customizable reading experience with offline capabilities and iCloud sync. The app is gorgeous.</p>
<p>For bookmark management, I shifted from <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a> (via an app I wrote) to <a href="https://raindrop.io">Raindrop</a>, and now to <a href="https://anybox.app">Anybox</a>. Initially, I thought about updating my Pinboard app and making it service independent, synchronizing via iCloud, but Anybox&rsquo;s features made that idea unnecessary. It&rsquo;s a tool I wish I had discovered earlier. I went ahead and bought the lifetime license.</p>
<p>While <em>tinyScientist</em> was hospitalized, I shuttled between cities with my notebook. A heavy snowstorm made me anxious about data security, leading me to <a href="https://www.arqbackup.com">Arq</a> for reliable backups.</p>
<p>Also, renewed <a href="https://otavio.lol">otavio.lol</a> for another year. This is the domain I use for <a href="https://home.omg.lol">omg.lol</a> services.</p>
<h2 id="hacking">Hacking</h2>
<p>A personal joy in programming is creating my own applications. I&rsquo;ve developed an <em>almost</em> complete <a href="https://home.omg.lol">omg.lol</a> app for personal use (managing webpage, /now page, status messages, pastebin, etc.), which I&rsquo;ve delayed releasing due to&hellip; <em>perfectionism</em>. However, I&rsquo;m now considering its release as I start a new venture: a character sheet management app for pen-and-paper dungeon crawling games.</p>
<p>Perhaps launching a Kickstarter for my apps could be a way to dedicate more time to these projects.</p>
<p><strong>Last but not least</strong>, Obsidian is hosting the <a href="https://obsidian.md/blog/2023-goty-nominations/">2023 Gems of the Year</a>. I&rsquo;ve submitted my plugin, <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.publish</a> (<a href="https://github.com/otaviocc/obsidian-microblog">GitHub link</a>), but it would be fantastic to see submissions from users as well. <strong>Your support would be greatly appreciated!</strong></p>
<p>Look forward to the next set of weekly notes in the upcoming year.</p>
<p>Happy New Year! 🎆 🎉 🍾</p>

			 <p>I recently added a page to my mini <a href="https://otavio.cc/kleingarten/">Digital Garden</a> featuring the <a href="https://otavio.cc/subscriptions/">list of subscriptions</a> I currently pay for. However, like all pages in a Digital Garden, it is constantly evolving, receiving frequent updates to reflect new information.</p>
<p>Therefore, I decided to replicate its content in the form of a blog post. This way, a year from now, I can revisit this post and reflect on the decisions I&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Prime - <code>90 €/year</code></li>
<li>Apple TV+ (as part of the Apple One subscription)</li>
<li>Disney Plus - <code>9 €/month</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We canceled Netflix during the pandemic and have not returned since. There might be a TV show or two that we are missing, but given the limited time we have, the abundance of content available is already overwhelming.</p>
<h2 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dithering.fm">Dithering</a> - <code>$50/year</code></li>
<li><a href="https://www.20k.org">Twenty Thousand Hertz+</a> - <code>$40.00/year</code></li>
<li><a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar">Under the Radar</a> - <code>$50/year</code></li>
</ul>
<p>However, I might replace Dithering with something else next time. Also, I would subscribe to 99% Invisible if that were an option. 99% Invisible and Twenty Thousand Hertz are my all-time favorite shows, and I’m glad I can support Twenty Thousand Hertz+ in some way.</p>
<h2 id="services">Services</h2>
<h3 id="must-have">Must-Have</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://proton.me">Proton</a> - <code>95 €/year</code> (190 € every two years, actually).</li>
<li><a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a> - <code>$60/year</code></li>
<li><a href="https://relay.firefox.com">Firefox Relay</a> - <code>12 €/year</code></li>
<li><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-one/">Apple One</a> - <code>35 €/month</code></li>
<li><a href="https://arqbackup.com/">Arq</a> - <code>$59.99/year</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These are indispensable to me.</p>
<h3 id="blogsocial">Blog/Social</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> - <code>$100/year</code></li>
<li><a href="https://home.omg.lol">omg.lol</a> - <code>$20/year</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These are the best online communities one could hope for.</p>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://feedbin.com">Feedbin</a> - <code>$50/year</code></li>
<li><a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> - <code>$30/year</code></li>
<li>Local Library - <code>10 €/year</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve experimented with numerous reading apps and read-later services, only to return to Feedbin and Instapaper in the end. I am not planning to change this setup anytime soon.</p>
<p>The Local Library is listed here because I can use <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby">Libby</a> (and some other reading apps) with my subscription.</p>
<h3 id="fun-to-have">Fun to Have</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> - <code>$20/month</code></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/switch/online/nintendo-switch-online/">Nintendo Switch Online + Erweiterungspaket</a> - <code>40 €/year</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="apps">Apps</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a> - <code>30 €/year</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve tried various Mastodon clients and always end up coming back to Ivory. It may not have all the features of some other clients, but it is the most polished and performant among them.</p>

			 <p>This week, we took <em>tinyScientist</em> to the hospital for the removal of his bandage and stitches. Thankfully, this ordeal is now over. The next appointment is scheduled for 4-6 weeks from now, just to check on his progress.</p>
<p>The following day, we visited the Embassy to renew his passport. I had <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/11/18/week.html">initiated the process about a month ago</a>, but we had to put it on hold because they retain the old passport, and we didn&rsquo;t want him to be without identification during <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/12/09/week.html">the time he was in the hospital</a>.</p>
<p>After our trip to the Embassy, we stopped by a bakery for a bite to eat, and <em>tinyScientist</em> experienced his first taste of bread. It was awesome to watch him clutch the bread with both hands, attacking it with gusto.</p>
<p>This week, I also updated my mini <a href="https://otavio.cc/kleingarten/">Digital Garden</a> 🪴, adding two new pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://otavio.cc/subscriptions/">Subscriptions</a> - A list of my active subscriptions and their costs.</li>
<li><a href="https://otavio.cc/springboard/">SpringBoard</a> - A questionnaire about the apps on my phone, including my wallpaper.</li>
</ul>
<p>These pages serve as a complement to the <a href="https://otavio.cc/app-defaults/">App Defaults</a> page I published a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Last week, I mentioned considering moving <strong>The Dungeon Artist</strong> to omg.lol, and I&rsquo;ve now done so. Currently, there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://epictalestavern.omg.lol">simple profile page</a> with links to the <a href="https://epictalestavern.com">blog</a> and the newly migrated <a href="https://social.lol/@epictalestavern">Mastodon account</a> (on <a href="https://social.lol">social.lol</a>).</p>
<p>Additionally, in place of traditional New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions, I&rsquo;ve opted to set personal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results">Objectives and Key Results</a> (OKRs) for 2024. This approach, inspired by my work experience — particularly in writing OKRs for both personal development and technical objectives for the macOS team — seemed more structured and potentially more effective for personal goals as well.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I’m back on Bluesky: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/otavio.cc">@otavio.cc</a>.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/12/09/week.html">Last week</a>, I took the entire week off due to <em>tinyScientist</em>&rsquo;s surgery. The surgery, being in a different city, ruled out the possibility of working due to the extensive commute. During this time, I chose to stay with my son and wife at the hospital.</p>
<p>Upon my return to work on Monday, I had a lot to catch up on. My schedule was completely filled with clearing Slack messages and emails, except for the times I was occupied in meetings.</p>
<p><em>tinyScientist</em>&rsquo;s recovery over the week has been impressive. He is healing well and is scheduled to have his bandages and stitches removed next week. He’s eating everything and drinking normally.</p>
<p>I launched a new blog, <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/12/13/epic-tales-tavern.html">Epic Tales Tavern</a>, which also gets published on Mastodon. I have plans for this blog, which motivated me to invest in a dedicated domain. Considering the vibrant community at <a href="https://social.lol/">social.lol</a>, I&rsquo;m contemplating moving the Mastodon account there at some point.</p>
<p>The remainder of the week was dedicated to meetings and interviewing candidates.</p>

			 <p>I’ve created a new blog named <a href="https://epictalestavern.com">Epic Tales Tavern</a>, dedicated to sharing AI-generated images of unique and unusual dungeon encounters.</p>
<p>Initially, I shared these images on Mastodon. However, I realized the benefit of creating a dedicated space for them. Using <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>’s cross-posting feature, I can share these images with my Mastodon followers from their new home.</p>
<p>Previously, I had a separate blog for my photography but eventually decided to integrate these photos into my personal blog, leading to the closure of the separate photo blog.</p>
<p>This time, it feels right to maintain a separate blog for “Epic Tales Tavern.” Viewing it more as a project, a dedicated blog seems fitting.</p>
<p>Both my <a href="https://otavio.cc">personal blog</a> and <a href="https://epictalestavern.com">Epic Tales Tavern</a> are published on <a href="https://micro.blog/otaviocc">my Micro.blog timeline</a>. However, as they are distinct blogs, they each have their own RSS feeds and can be followed individually.</p>
<p>Lastly, I’m thinking of sharing my solo campaigns and the maps I create during these campaigns on “Epic Tales Tavern.”</p>

			 <p>Yesterday, I decided to give Ulysses another try and installed it. My library is quite small as I’ve only moved a few notes to test it out. However, the first thing I noticed was the app’s launch time. On my iPhone 15 Pro Max, it takes several seconds just to launch the app and display the library.</p>

			 <p>It was an intense week that began early on Sunday. My <em>tinyScientist</em>&rsquo;s second surgery — of two!!! — was scheduled for Monday, but we were asked to come to the hospital the day before to speak with the doctors and sign necessary documents. Since the hospital is in a nearby city, we had to leave our home early to catch the train and buses, ensuring we arrived on Sunday at the scheduled time.</p>
<p>Given that the surgery was set for Monday, we booked a hotel room for Sunday night, allowing us to be at the hospital first thing in the morning. However, on Sunday, the hospital staff suggested that it would be better for my wife and son to stay in the hospital overnight. Consequently, I ended up going to the hotel alone.</p>
<p>Monday started early as well. But in the morning, we learned that the surgery was scheduled for 1pm. Having had his last meal at 4am, my son was understandably a bit irritable due to hunger, but this is a normal procedure for surgeries involving anesthesia.</p>
<p>The surgery started precisely at 1pm and ended at 5:30pm. With limited activities to pass the time in a hospital, especially with it snowing outside, we stayed in their room during the surgery. Once it was over, we were contacted to go to the recovery block to be there as he woke up and to accompany him back to their room.</p>
<p>His first surgery took 7 hours from the initial incision to the final stitch, but this didn&rsquo;t make this one, which lasted &ldquo;only&rdquo; 4.5 hours, any less stressful. We were anxious, but confident, knowing that the surgeons were the best in the country and renowned internationally in their field.</p>
<p><em>tinyScientist</em> coped well with the surgery. After a restful night from Monday to Tuesday, he woke up playful, &ldquo;talking&rdquo; to <em>scientist</em> and his toys.</p>
<p>Initially, he showed resistance to drinking water or milk but accepted food without an issues. To ensure he stayed hydrated, my wife began adding water and milk into his meals.</p>
<p>Wednesday and Thursday were the same, but with gradual improvement in drinking water and milk. By Thursday night, he no longer needed painkillers. The doctor was unable to visit <em>tinyScientist</em> and another boy who underwent the same surgery, but we were informed they would come on Friday morning before performing new surgeries.</p>
<p>I was going back-and-forth between the two cities everyday, but on Thursday there was a 24-hour train strike starting in the evening, forcing me to book a hotel room and stay in the city.</p>
<p>We were all awake by 6am on Friday, eagerly awaiting the doctor&rsquo;s visit. Around 7am, <em>tinyScientist</em> was visited by the doctor and received the green light to leave the hospital!</p>
<p>With the trains still not operational, <em>tinyScientist</em>&rsquo;s godmother kindly offered to pick us up from the hospital and take us back home.</p>
<p>The bravery and resilience displayed by my wife and son, particularly my one-year-old <em>tinyScientist</em>, were profoundly inspiring throughout this challenging week. In the face of all the stress of a medical procedure, my wife remained a pillar of strength, providing support and comfort to our son. Meanwhile, <em>tinyScientist</em> showed extraordinary courage. His ability to remain playful and spirited, after undergoing surgery, reflects a remarkable inner strength. Their fortitude in these trying times is not only inspiring but also a profound source of pride for me.</p>

			 <p>Like most weekends lately, we hung out at home, keeping our distance because <em>tinyScientist</em> has surgery coming up. We really can&rsquo;t get sick right now; otherwise, he&rsquo;ll be pushed back to the end of the queue, which we&rsquo;re trying to avoid.</p>
<p>But on Sunday, we spent quite a bit of time in our basement (or <em>Keller</em>, as call it in Germany), cleaning it up, sorting out stuff to donate, and throwing away things we don’t need anymore.</p>
<p>Monday evening, I went to tabletop game store and grabbed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingspan_(board_game)">Wingspan</a>, a game that’s not only beautiful but also gets a lot of praise. We’re hoping to play it while <em>tinyScientist</em> is asleep, though we haven’t gotten around to it yet.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the <strong>D100 Dungeon</strong> books I ordered showed up way earlier than I thought they would. Playing with the actual books instead of scrolling through PDFs on a computer or iPad is so much better. I also got another book, <strong>D100 Dungeon Book 6: World Builder</strong>, to add more to the game. This one should be arriving next week.</p>
<p>Wednesday morning came with snow. My day was back-to-back meetings starting at 9:30am, and I spent it watching the snow from my home office window. In the evening, I just had to go outside. It was really fun to see <em>tinyScientist</em> walking in the snow.</p>
<p>On Thursday, I decided to stop the auto-renewal for two domains I have since I don&rsquo;t really have big plans or a strong connection to them. I’m keeping just <a href="https://otavio.cc">otavio.cc</a> and <a href="https://otavio.lol">otavio.lol</a>, the ones I actually use.</p>
<p>I’ve also switched from Overcast to Apple Podcasts because I like Apple&rsquo;s recommendations better. So, I ended up deleting my Overcast account.</p>
<p>I’m also thinking of dropping Telegram. Most people I talk to are on different platforms, and I barely use the app, so I might delete my account.</p>
<p>Also on Thursday, I saw that Glass is raising their prices. I like Glass, but it&rsquo;s a closed platform, and I already post my photos on this blog. So, I&rsquo;m thinking over whether I should renew my subscription.</p>
<p>I’ve switched up my Mastodon client too, from Ivory to Mona. Mona feels more in tune with what Mastodon is all about.</p>
<p>Later in the week, we caught up on “Lessons in Chemistry.” It’s a great TV show and has got me interested in reading the book.</p>
<p>And finally, Apple Music dropped their annual Replay. No shocker, “A Pirate Says Arr” from The Backyardigans was at the top of my list. But Metal and Hard Rock are still my go-to genres, just like in Spotify days.</p>

			 <p>Once upon a typical day in the life of a dad/physicist/engineer, I faced a mission of utmost importance: rescuing my son&rsquo;s toy from the clutches of malfunction. Armed with my trusty Swiss Army Knife — the <a href="https://www.victorinox.com/us/en/Products/Swiss-Army-Knives/Medium-Pocket-Knives/Cyber-Tool-L/p/1.7775.T">Cyber Tool L</a> — I embarked on this domestic adventure, feeling every bit the hero.</p>
<p>The toy, a vibrant concoction of buttons and lights, lay inoperative, a silent sentinel in the dinning table. With the precision of a skilled surgeon (or a software engineer moonlighting as a toy doctor), I pried open the toy&rsquo;s plastic chassis. Inside, a jumble of wires and batteries greeted me, resembling a tiny, intricate puzzle ready to be solved.</p>
<p>Channeling my inner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver">MacGyver</a>, I dove into the task. Wires were reconnected with the finesse of a cybersecurity expert defusing a digital threat. Batteries were replaced with the efficiency of a pit stop crew at the Formula 1. With a triumphant click, I sealed the toy, its colorful exterior belying the intricate surgery it had just undergone.</p>
<p>The moment of truth arrived. I pressed the buttons and voilà! The toy sprang to life, blaring its electronic symphony. Success! I turned, expecting to see my son&rsquo;s face lit up with joy, ready to embrace his newly revived electronic companion.</p>
<p>But no. Instead, I was met with an unexpected demand. With the earnestness only a toddler can muster, he pointed not at the toy, but at the Swiss Army Knife in my hand. Forget the toy; this shiny, gadget-laden marvel had captured his fascination.</p>
<p>In that instant, I realized the true hero of this story wasn&rsquo;t me or the toy — it was the Swiss Army Knife. A trusty sidekick, overshadowing the main act.</p>
<p>And there I stood, a dad outsmarted by a toddler and his newfound love for multipurpose tools.</p>
<p>My f* Cyber Tool.</p>

			 <p>After updating to Sonoma, I encountered an issue where my mouse movements and the dragging of items became noticeably slow. However, this only happened when my MacBook Pro was open and connected to an external display. When using a single display setup, either with the MacBook Pro or the external display, everything worked as expected.</p>
<p>I resolved the issue through a few steps within the System Settings. I fixed it by going to System Settings &gt; Displays &gt; Advanced&hellip; &gt; Show resolutions as list &gt; Show all resolutions.</p>
<p>In this list, I selected the same resolution I was already using, but specifically chose the option offering a Refresh Rate of 60 Hertz. By default, it had been set to a variant supporting only 30 Hertz.</p>

			 <p>The weather was awful on Sunday, and since we have to keep social distancing we stayed at home. Actually, in the afternoon I went to a copy/binding store to print and bind the D100 Dungeon book (yes, I bought the PDF). Unfortunately the thumb-drive didn&rsquo;t work; I use macOS, but I formatted the drive for Windows and for some reason it didn&rsquo;t work. Anyway, maybe I should buy the print-on-demand copy instead.</p>
<p>Later that day, I rolled the dice and created my character. It&rsquo;s an Elf in the Rogue hero path, called <strong>Thalion Whisperwind</strong>. I wrote a <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/11/20/from-dice-to.html">blog post</a> about his creation and how I used DALL-E to create an illustration of him.</p>
<p>On the topic of dungeons and DALL-E, I&rsquo;ve started a new Mastodon account, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dungeonartist">The Dungeon Artist</a>, where I post daily images of unique dungeon encounters. This project is so fun. I just hope to maintain my creativity with the prompts. To streamline the process while ensuring consistency, I&rsquo;ve developed a custom &ldquo;GPT&rdquo; pre-loaded with dungeon setups, color palettes, animation styles, and other details, significantly accelerating the creative process.</p>
<p>My wife and I recently celebrated our 20th anniversary! It sometimes seems like it was just yesterday, but reflecting on everything that&rsquo;s happened since then – our time in Brazil, Canada, the United States, Germany, our academic pursuits including College, Masters, her PhD, and most importantly, <em>tinyScientist</em> – it&rsquo;s been an incredible journey. Our first interaction was via IRC!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll always cherish the memory of waiting in line to watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings%3A_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring">Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</a> and spotting a group at the front, among whom was a girl wearing a Tolkien t-shirt. Later, while dating <em>scientist</em>, I discovered she was that very girl!</p>
<p>Finally, on Friday night I worked on a new feature for <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.publish</a> (still pending release) that enables users to <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/11/25/im-adding-a.html">compose and publish microposts directly from Obsidian</a> without needing to create a file. Why did I do it? I’m not sure. Perhaps I don’t want to open a browser just to post, or maybe I’m not logged into the page. Or, it could be simply because coding new features is fun. Who knows?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>On Sunday night, I decided to pick the <strong>D100 Dungeon</strong> system to play and rolled the dice to create my character. I ended up with an Elf in the Rogue hero path, whom I&rsquo;ve named <strong>Thalion Whisperwind</strong>. &lsquo;Thalion&rsquo; means <em>strong</em> in Elvish, which, combined with &lsquo;Whisperwind,&rsquo; suggests a character who is both powerful and as silent as the wind. Ironically, this isn&rsquo;t actually true! While Thalion excels in dexterity and intelligence, he&rsquo;s not particularly strong. Poor guy.</p>
<p>One exciting aspect of rolling the dice to build my character was determining his armor and weapon. This process provided me with enough information to envision Thalion clearly. So, I turned to DALL-E, armed with context from a previous chat session about a dungeon and characters reminiscent of human figures in Pixar animations, and asked it to create an illustration of my rogue elf.</p>
<p><img src="https://otavio.cc/uploads/2023/rogue-elf-character.png" alt="DALL-E render of a rogue Elf for an RPG adventure"></p>
<p>I absolutely love the result!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m even considering taking Thalion&rsquo;s journey a step further. The illustration is so awesome that I&rsquo;m tempted to print it out. It would be the perfect addition to his character sheet.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m starting a new RPG adventure and want to visually bring my characters to life. Drawing them myself was an option, but due to time constraints and my rusty drawing skills, I turned to <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e">DALL-E</a> for image generation.</p>
<p>To simplify the process, I detailed my requirements and preferences to ChatGPT, outlining the specific instructions for our session.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll ask you to generate a few portrait photos of characters for an RPG campaign (one at a time). All the images should be set in the same environment, a dark dungeon, with moss on the walls and dim light. Also, all the images should have the aspect ratio 2:3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After, I requested images for four characters: a female Barbarian, a male Cleric, a female Rogue, and a male Wizard. The initial results were good but lacked a cohesive style.</p>
<p>Looking for a uniform look across all images, I turned to ChatGPT for guidance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there any information I could provide you in order to keep consistency across all the images generated? I want all of them with the same &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT&rsquo;s advice was invaluable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To ensure uniformity in your RPG campaign&rsquo;s character portraits, consider specifying these elements for each character:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Environment:</strong> Your description of a dark dungeon with moss-covered walls is a great start. Feel free to add more details like torches or specific stone textures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lighting and Mood:</strong> Given the dungeon setting, aim for dim, atmospheric lighting. If you desire specific effects like shadows or glowing objects, do mention them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Character Positioning and Expression:</strong> Specify the characters&rsquo; orientation (facing forward, sideways, etc.), along with their facial expressions and body language to reflect their personalities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clothing and Style:</strong> Describe their attire, armor, and overall style, including colors, materials, and any era-specific details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Physical Characteristics:</strong> Detail each character&rsquo;s race, gender, hair, eye color, and distinctive features like scars or tattoos, as well as their build.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessories and Weapons:</strong> Include any accessories, weapons, or magical items they might carry or wear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Color Palette and Art Style:</strong> If you have preferences for the color scheme or a specific art style (like realistic, fantasy, etc.), let us know.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Providing these details will help us create portraits that consistently align with your campaign&rsquo;s dungeon setting. Let&rsquo;s begin with the first character – the more details, the better!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Armed with this advice, I provided general specs for items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7, applicable to all characters. Items 5 and 6 were left open for &ldquo;creative&rdquo; interpretation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go with:</p>
<ol>
<li>The dungeon comprises large stone blocks, featuring arches and columns, with moss covering the walls and floor.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s dark, illuminated by torches in corridors and halls, casting dim light.</li>
<li>Characters should face forward, as in a portrait photograph, making eye contact with the viewer.</li>
<li>Their clothing is from circa 1200.</li>
<li>The color palette is predominantly dark, accented with dramatic splashes of color. The art style should resemble humans in Pixar animations.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>With these refined prompts, I requested new images for the female Barbarian, male Cleric, female Rogue, and male Wizard.</p>
<p>Female Barbarian:</p>
<p><img src="https://otavio.cc/uploads/2023/rpgcharacter1.png" alt="Illustration generated using DALL-E of a female barbarian in Pixar animation style"></p>
<p>Male Cleric:</p>
<p><img src="https://otavio.cc/uploads/2023/rpgcharacter2.png" alt="Illustration generated using DALL-E of a male cleric in Pixar animation style"></p>
<p>Female Rogue:</p>
<p><img src="https://otavio.cc/uploads/2023/rpgcharacter3.png" alt="Illustration generated using DALL-E of a female rogue in Pixar animation style"></p>
<p>Male Wizard:</p>
<p><img src="https://otavio.cc/uploads/2023/rpgcharacter4.png" alt="Illustration generated using DALL-E of a male wizard in Pixar animation style"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more than satisfied with the results. The images uniformly capture the desired &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo; and truly echo Pixar&rsquo;s animation style.</p>
<p>Next, I requested a change in style (why not, right?):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s change the style of the characters. They should look like LEGO minifigures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I then asked for new images for my four characters in this new style.</p>
<p>Female Barbarian:</p>
<p><img src="https://otavio.cc/uploads/2023/rpgcharacter5.png" alt="Illustration generated using DALL-E of a female barbarian as a LEGO Minifigure"></p>
<p>Male Cleric:</p>
<p><img src="https://otavio.cc/uploads/2023/rpgcharacter6.png" alt="Illustration generated using DALL-E of a male cleric as a LEGO Minifigure"></p>
<p>Female Rogue:</p>
<p><img src="https://otavio.cc/uploads/2023/rpgcharacter7.png" alt="Illustration generated using DALL-E of a female rogue as a LEGO Minifigure"></p>
<p>Male Wizard:</p>
<p><img src="https://otavio.cc/uploads/2023/rpgcharacter8.png" alt="Illustration generated using DALL-E of a male wizard as a LEGO Minifigure"></p>
<p>Writing precise prompts with ChatGPT&rsquo;s support significantly improved the results. It allowed me to articulate what I wanted before requesting images, leading to a collection of consistent and engaging character portraits.</p>
<p>I could easily lose myself for hours experimenting with various styles and fine-tuning prompts, but it&rsquo;s time to set DALL-E aside and embark on this exciting new adventure.</p>

			 <p>This week began with me literally printing documents at midnight. I found myself in the kitchen, searching for an outlet to charge our printer for printing all the paperwork to renew <em>tinyScientist</em>&rsquo;s passport.</p>
<p>Curiously, our Canon Printer flashes a green light when its battery is low and needs charging, and blinks red while recharging. This is counterintuitive to me – I would have expected a blinking red light to signal the need for recharging. This design choice remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Monday was a day off for me, as we had appointments with <em>tinyScientist</em>&rsquo;s doctors in preparation for his upcoming surgery. Thankfully, everything is in order; we just have to wait a few more weeks. Soon, this will all be in the past.</p>
<p>I was looking for solo pen-and-paper RPG games, and found a game called <strong>Four Against Darkness</strong>. Further research led me to another solo system, <strong>D100 Dungeon</strong>. While not strictly RPGs, they are close enough and serve my purpose well. I&rsquo;ve finished the game book for Four Against Darkness and am about to start on the D100 Dungeon book. Then I&rsquo;ll decide which one I&rsquo;m gonna invest my time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also started reading a book by Brazilian cartoonist Mauricio Ricardo, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Missioni-hist%C3%B3ria-brasileiros-guerra-Portuguese-ebook/dp/B0CMKLM1QQ">Missioni: Uma História sobre Brasileiros em Guerra</a>. I expect to finish it either today or tomorrow. It&rsquo;s a good book and a good summary of how things work in Brazil.</p>
<p>A new hobby of mine is creating images with DALL-E 3. I&rsquo;ve been updating the cover art for my Apple Music playlists using the tool, based on the songs in each playlist. The Music app looks much nicer now!</p>
<p>However, following the latest major ChatGPT update, I feel that DALL-E 3&rsquo;s performance has slightly deteriorated, along with the system&rsquo;s overall stability. In recent days, I&rsquo;ve encountered numerous errors and slowdowns while generating images.</p>
<p>Lastly, I&rsquo;ve made <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/11/15/bear-and-obsidian.html">the decision to transfer my notes from Obsidian to Bear</a>. This isn&rsquo;t my first time switching between these platforms, and I suspect I might revert to Obsidian again. More to come.</p>

<p>I was planning to create a <strong>long and detailed list of pros and cons</strong> to decide between <a href="https://bear.app">Bear</a> and <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>. However, I realized that lists can be easily skewed to favor a particular outcome. For example, if comparing an iPhone with a potato, we could ask which one stays on the kitchen counter longer without needing a charge, right?</p>
<p>Obsidian is impressive. I can use it across all my devices, whether personal or for work, and it&rsquo;s easily enhanced with third-party plugins. This includes a plugin I created for publishing posts and pages directly to <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>. However, Obsidian has its downsides. It&rsquo;s not a native app, which affects its aesthetics and functionality, especially on mobile devices. Additionally, its synchronization service can be quite expensive.</p>
<p>Bear, conversely, is simple and intuitive. It integrates seamlessly with the Apple ecosystem, which suits me fine. However, its synchronization is limited to devices under the same iCloud account, which is problematic since I use different accounts for personal and work purposes. Bear does require a subscription for synchronization, but it&rsquo;s much more affordable compared to Obsidian.</p>
<p>Feature-wise, both are excellent. They are robust markdown editors, support linking between notes, code blocks with syntax highlighting, and allow inline images, which is all I really need.</p>
<p>So, my choice boils down to the one that precisely meets my needs without overcomplicating things or offering an overwhelming array of customization options. After all, sometimes less is more. Plus, it doesn&rsquo;t cost nearly 100 EUR/year just to host a few text files.</p>
<p>PS: The image which illustrates this post was generated using DALL-E 3.</p>

			 <p>Last weekend I started feeling unwell. By Sunday night, my condition had worsened significantly. As result, I took sick leave on Monday, Tuesday, and also on Wednesday. By Thursday, I managed to return to work, though I had not fully recovered.</p>
<p>On Friday, feeling better and back to full health, I headed to the office. It was quieter than usual since most of my colleagues prefer to work from home at the end of the week. However, in my team, we have time dedicated to learning on Fridays, and I find the office to be an ideal environment for this.</p>
<p>Out of caution, I took several COVID tests during the week, all of which thankfully returned negative. This means I have managed to stay COVID-free after all these years.</p>
<p>On a brighter note, I released a <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/10/31/micropublish.html">new version</a> of <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.publish</a>, which now enables users to <strong>publish and update pages</strong> from <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> to <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> directly. My reliance on Obsidian for writing and frequent updates to Micro.blog made it a natural progression to add this feature. The updated plugin was rolled out to all users on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The following day, <a href="https://manton.org">Manton</a> rolled out an update to the Micro.blog’s API that allows developers to choose whether a page should be included in the blog’s navigation. From the UX perspective this is great, so on Wednesday, I released <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/11/01/micropublish.html">Micro.publish 2.2.0</a>, featuring this latest addition.</p>
<p>After introducing page support to Micro.publish, I manually imported all the pages I had into Obsidian. <strong>I can now use Obsidian as the primary platform for editing my mini Digital Garden</strong>. With just a few clicks, any changes I make go live instantly.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, a group from <a href="https://glass.photo">Glass</a> went on a photowalk to capture some beautiful street photography, marking their first official meetup. Unfortunately, I had to miss this event thanks to the cold, which was quite disappointing.</p>
<p>In between everything, I managed to squeeze in a visit to the Apple Store for an in-store trade-in. I erased all data from my old iPhone 13 Pro Max and an iPad that I no longer used and returned them over to Apple. As a result, I got my <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/10/29/week.html">new iPhone</a> <em>without</em> having to pay anything.</p>
<p>However, the transition wasn&rsquo;t entirely seamless. In setting up my new iPhone, I was unexpectedly locked out of my banking app. My bank flagged the new device setup at 3am as suspicious, and I had to visit a physical branch to resolve the issue. Although this likely could have been handled over the phone, I used the opportunity to take care of some other banking tasks I had been delaying.</p>
<p>To my surprise and delight, the coffee shop next to my bank branch had reopened. I had a great flat white and a fantastic lemon poppy seed muffin — a small treat that added a sweet note to my day.</p>
<p>Lastly, I revisited a long-paused pastime in entertainment; I finally finished watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mentalist">The Mentalist</a>, a TV show I began over a decade ago but never saw through to the end. The series was put on hold when I moved between countries, and for years, the show remained unfinished. Returning to it after such a long time was truly gratifying. The show is exceptional, and completing it brought a satisfying sense of closure to a chapter that had remained open for far too long.</p>
<p>All things considered, despite some setbacks, it was a good week.</p>

			 <p>A couple of days ago, I released <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/10/31/micropublish.html">Micro.publish version 2.1.0</a>, which introduced the ability to publish and update pages on Micro.blog.</p>
<p>However, there was a limitation. Pages created using the Micropub API would invariably be added to the blog&rsquo;s navigation, which, in most Micro.blog themes, appears as a bar at the top of the page.</p>
<p>Since its release, <a href="https://manton.org">Manton</a> has updated the Micropub API to accept a new parameter, <code>mp-navigation</code>. This addition allows developers to control whether a page should be included in the navigation bar.</p>
<p>With Micro.publish 2.2.0, a fresh option is now available in the plugin settings. Users can determine the default setting for including new pages in the blog navigation.</p>
<p><img src="https://otavio.cc/uploads/2023/settings-page-navigation.png" alt="Settings for page navigation"></p>
<p>When publishing a new page, users have the opportunity to override this default setting for the specific page they are working on.</p>
<p><img src="https://otavio.cc/uploads/2023/override-page-navigation.png" alt="Override option for page navigation"></p>
<p>I cannot express enough gratitude to Manton for the API change. It significantly enhances the Micro.publish experience for all the users who regularly use the plugin.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/10/29/week.html">previous weekly note</a>, I&rsquo;ve been working on a new <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.publish</a> feature. This feature enables users to publish Pages directly to <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> and also provides the capability to update pages previously published using version 2.1.0 or later.</p>
<p>To provide clarity and coherence, I&rsquo;ve renamed the existing Obsidian commands. Now, to publish and update a post, users can use the following command in Obsidian&rsquo;s Command Palette:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Micro.publish: Publish Post to Micro.blog</em></li>
</ul>
<p>And, for publishing and updating a page, the command is:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Micro.publish: Publish Page to Micro.blog</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Due to certain <a href="https://book.micro.blog/micropub/">Micropub</a> limitations, it&rsquo;s currently impossible to prevent new pages from appearing in the blog&rsquo;s navigation bar by default. Thus, after publishing a new page, should a user wish to exclude the page from the navigation bar, they would need to manually visit their &lsquo;Pages&rsquo; section in Micro.blog and remove it from the navigation bar. Fortunately, once removed, subsequent updates to the page from Obsidian won&rsquo;t add the link back to the navigation bar.</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, there is a workaround. However, it would require the use of outdated APIs. I&rsquo;m hesitant to combine two distinct technologies unless it becomes a issue for many users.</p>
<p>The update rolls out to all users tomorrow.</p>
<p>P.S. The image in this post was generate using <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-3">DALL-E 3</a>. I wish I could draw like this.</p>

			 <h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>I began the week by heading to the office. As we were initiating a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Sprint">Sprint</a>, my schedule was filled with an array of sessions, ranging from retrospectives to daily meetings, and from pre-planning to planning sessions. Additionally, I had several one-on-one meetings.</p>
<p>Mondays at the office are always delightful. The kitchen brims with fresh croissants, sandwiches, and a huge variety of tempting pastries.</p>
<p>By Friday, I found myself back at the office. Given our dedicated Learning Time on Fridays, it&rsquo;s an ideal day to be there in person, facilitating activities such as pair programming or collaborative tasks with colleagues. That afternoon, three of us collaborated in a meeting room, focusing on modularizing a particular feature.</p>
<p>The Office Manager from our German branch was in the midst of giving our workspace a Halloween facelift. I particularly loved how she swapped out our <a href="https://otavio.cc/2022/10/14/went-to-the.html">Unicorn</a> for a festive-themed one. A charming touch.</p>
<p><img src="https://otavio.cc/uploads/2023/img-99636655-vintagekodak.jpeg" alt="Halloween Unicorn"></p>
<h2 id="hacking">Hacking</h2>
<p>Last week, I published a <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> plugin called &ldquo;Reply on Mastodon.&rdquo; Although I&rsquo;m not using it – as posts on my Mastodon account are programmed to auto-delete after a month – I&rsquo;ve been buoyed by the positive feedback from those who&rsquo;ve adopted the plugin. While I ensure all my content is preserved on my blog, my Mastodon operates differently.</p>
<p>Since I rely on Obsidian for my writing and publish posts and pages to Micro.blog, I&rsquo;ve embarked on developing a new <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.publish</a> feature. This will enable users to upload pages directly from the editor. I&rsquo;m optimistic about rolling out this feature by next Tuesday or Wednesday, contingent upon the time I can allocate.</p>
<h2 id="new-iphone">New iPhone</h2>
<p>This Wednesday, for a fleeting moment, Apple stocked the iPhone <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/10/14/week.html">I had wanted</a>. However, due to my back-to-back meetings, I missed the chance to snag it. By the time I was free to visit the store, the model was out of stock.</p>
<p>Can you believe the same happened on Thursday?</p>
<p>However, luck was on my side on Saturday morning. While waiting at the bakery, I impulsively checked the Apple Store app. To my astonishment, the exact model – in terms of color and capacity – was available. Within a mere 30 seconds, I managed to purchase both bread and a new iPhone.</p>
<h2 id="edc">EDC</h2>
<p>Last but not least, I recently received my much-anticipated order from JetPens: the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Tactile-Turn-Bolt-Action-Pen-Titanium/pd/24327">Tactile Turn Bolt Action Pen (Titanium)</a>. While I have a fondness for fountain pens, when it comes to everyday carry, this pen is unrivaled.</p>

			 <p>One of the advantages of a hybrid working model is the flexibility to work from home whenever I choose. However, the downside is that, when I opt to stay at home, I sometimes forget to leave the house for days. In fact, this week, the first time I stepped outside was on Thursday. On Friday, I decided to work from the office to get some fresh air, interact with people, and have lunch at a restaurant.</p>
<p><img src="https://otavio.cc/uploads/2023/img-8608-edited-edited.jpg" alt="Photo of a hot stone pot Bibimbap, a Korean rice dish"></p>
<p>For my <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> client for macOS and iOS, I had plans to complete the migration from the <code>ObservableObject</code> protocol to Apple&rsquo;s new Observation framework introduced earlier this year, but unfortunately, I couldn&rsquo;t find the time for it. My Xcode has been open on my personal computer for over a week, with the same files still awaiting edits.</p>
<p>There were no new features implemented on <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.publish</a> either. The only Micro.publish related change during the week was the addition of a link in my blog&rsquo;s navigation bar at the top of the page.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I did manage to carve out some time to create a plugin for a feature that the <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> community had been discussing, called <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/111">Reply on Mastodon</a>. This plugin generates a link that directs readers to the cross-post on Mastodon, allowing them to engage in conversations and reply.</p>
<p>The implementation was straightforward, but it required some adjustments on the Micro.blog side to function correctly. Essentially, the plugin needs cross-post information to add the link to the page. Naturally, you can&rsquo;t have the cross-post information before assembling the post to publish. Fortunately, Manton made the necessary changes on the Micro.blog side to ensure the plugin works as expected.</p>
<p>In addition to this, I submitted a Pull Request to integrate <em>Reply on Mastodon</em> directly into <a href="https://github.com/MattSLangford/Tiny-Theme-for-Micro.blog">Tiny Theme</a>. <a href="https://micro.blog/Mtt">Matt Langford</a> reviewed and released a new version of the theme on either Friday or Saturday (I can&rsquo;t recall the exact day). With this integration, users can effortlessly install the <em>Reply on Mastodon</em> plugin on their blogs, eliminating the need for complex integration and customization.</p>

<p>Getting the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/de/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Max</a> has become an incredibly challenging task. My mistake was waiting for the in-store launch to see and hold the device in my hands before placing an order, and it seems that the demand for this particular model is unprecedented. According to the Apple Store, the estimated delivery date is set for mid-November. I guess I&rsquo;ll just have to wait&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten back into listening to podcasts. I never actually took a break, but I used to skip episodes of some shows or completely ignore others. However, this week, I defined/found the lineup of shows that I enjoy and want to continue listening to. I&rsquo;ve also created some <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a> playlists to assist me in choosing the next episode to listen to. It&rsquo;s working quite well, and I&rsquo;m pleased with the outcomes. As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;m currently working on a blog post detailing the shows I&rsquo;m following and the setup I&rsquo;ve put in place for my podcast listening.</p>
<p>I took the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16 Personalities</a> test, which categorizes individuals into one of 16 personality types based on their preferences in five key traits: Extraverted/Introverted, Intuitive/Observant, Thinking/Feeling, Judging/Prospecting, and Assertive/Turbulent This test offers insights into how people perceive the world and make decisions. According to the test, I fall into the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality">Architect</a> (INTJ) personality type.</p>

Among all the Task Managers I&rsquo;ve tried, it&rsquo;s the one that requires the least time for curation or browsing whenever I need to tackle a task or have some free time. It simply gets the job done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a dedicated <a href="https://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a> user for a long time, consistently purchasing the latest version each time it&rsquo;s released. The most recent version of Dash introduced a subscription-based pricing model. However, I find this pricing structure to be fair and transparent, costing approximately $15 per year. Dash is the kind of application that I open when I start my computer and rarely close. I started using Dash years ago during a time when I used to disconnect from the internet to code without distractions. Dash became - and still is - my go-to resource whenever I want to access technical documentation. In my city, that&rsquo;s the equivalent of the price of three flat whites (including tips), making it an easy and worthwhile decision.</p>
<p>I use Safari on my personal devices, and I tried to do the same on my work device, but it was a complete struggle. My daily tasks involve juggling numerous tabs, initiatives, and boards, which can make Safari (and even Firefox or Chrome) feel cumbersome. However, <a href="https://arc.net/">Arc</a> has proven to be a lifesaver in helping me stay focused on what matters most, and the latest update has left me thoroughly impressed. Perhaps I should consider writing a post to share my experience with Arc.</p>
<h2 id="hacking">Hacking</h2>
<p>Now that Sonoma and iOS 17 have been released, I can finally shift my attention to some of the changes I had in mind for my <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> native client. One significant step I&rsquo;ve taken is migrating the entire Core Data implementation, which was used for local data persistence, to the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata">SwiftData</a> stack introduced by Apple during this year&rsquo;s WWDC.</p>
<p>While SwiftData may not have the same extensive track record as Core Data, which has been around for many years, it feels much more in sync with Swift&rsquo;s nature, considering it&rsquo;s purpose-built for seamless integration with Swift. Moreover, it excels when it comes to working with Swift Packages, outperforming Core Data in this regard.</p>
<p>The next step is migrating from the <code>ObservableObject</code> protocol to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Observation/Observable()">Observable macro</a>, which was also introduced by Apple during this year&rsquo;s WWDC.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>As they say, business as usual. I worked from the office on Monday and then took Thursday and Friday off to spend time with <em>tinyScientist</em> and <em>scientist</em>. It&rsquo;s just unfortunate that the weather didn&rsquo;t cooperate.</p>

			 <p>Last weekend, I installed the iPadOS Release Candidate on both of our iPads because I anticipated a busy week ahead and knew I wouldn&rsquo;t have much time to explore the new system. As for my phone and watch, I decided to wait for the official release.</p>
<p>This weekend, I did the same with Sonoma by installing it on my personal computer. There were a couple of new APIs I wanted to try, and considering the upcoming busy week, I thought it would be more convenient to do it this way.</p>
<p>Sonoma, along with iOS/iPadOS 17, finally introduced a feature I&rsquo;ve been longing for in Safari: Profiles. I had been using <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://arc.net">Arc</a> primarily for this feature, which allowed me to have separate containers for regular browsing, banking, online shopping, and more.</p>
<p>After upgrading all my devices, I dedicated some time to resetting Safari and transferring all my bookmarks back into it.</p>
<p>Speaking of Safari and Firefox, I came across a <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/09/22/this-morning-i.html">Firefox Coffee Stand</a> next to an Apple Store on Friday, with a sign that read, &ldquo;Safari is a great browser… to download Firefox.&rdquo; But I won&rsquo;t comment on this, as I use Safari on all my devices, while my wife prefers Firefox for hers&hellip;</p>
<p>I visited the Apple Store to check out the new iPhones and decided to get one. Apple offers a good trade-in value for my iPhone 13 Pro Max, so I made the decision to switch. The only problem is that it might take some time, as the Apple Store app indicates that there are currently no iPhones in stock, and the next delivery date is in November. This gives me ample time to decide whether I want to buy a FineWoven Case or not.</p>
<p>In the digital realm, I deleted my Bluesky, Twitter, Flickr, and Babbel accounts. I also removed my Playdate account since I don&rsquo;t plan on ordering a Playdate anytime soon.</p>
<p>And I made a minor adjustment to my <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.publish</a> plugin development workflow. Now, whenever I create a <code>git tag</code> on the plugin&rsquo;s source code, it triggers a <a href="https://github.com/otaviocc/obsidian-microblog/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml">GitHub Action that creates a release</a>. This eliminates the need for manual steps such as dragging and dropping files.</p>
<p>Other than that, business as usual. It was a busy week.</p>

			 <p>It was a shorter week for me as I took Friday off to unwind. Well, I must admit, I did spend some time reading and catching up on articles from the &lsquo;read-it-later&rsquo; service I use, and watching the news from my Country.</p>
<p>This week, <strong>I released version 2.0.0 of my Obsidian plug-in</strong>, <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.publish</a>, which now allows users to edit <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> posts that were previously published using the plug-in. Implementing this feature was a lot of fun, and I&rsquo;m thrilled with the results. In fact, both of the lengthy posts I published this week were composed and edited (a couple of times) using the plug-in:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/09/13/micropublish.html">Micro.publish 2.0.0</a></li>
<li><a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/09/14/the-day-i.html">The day I emailed Tim Cook</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As they say, “eat your own dog food.”</p>
<p>I also wrapped up the second season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_(TV_series)">The Bear</a>, which is a fantastic TV show. I&rsquo;m crossing my fingers for another season!</p>
<p>Additionally, I finished watching the second season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Afterparty_(TV_series)">The Afterparty</a> without any idea who the killer would turn out to be.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m all caught up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Murders_in_the_Building">Only Murders in the Building</a>, yet another killer — pun intended — TV show.</p>
<p>On the digital front, I decided to delete my <a href="https://pixelfed.social/">Pixelfed</a>, <a href="https://lemmy.world/">Lemmy</a>, and <a href="https://kbin.social/">Kbin</a> accounts. Since I never really used these accounts, it made sense to bid them farewell.</p>
<p>Lastly, there&rsquo;s some exciting news on the personal front: <strong>tinyScientist sprouted another tooth</strong>! The milestones just keep coming!</p>

			 <p>Over a decade ago, there was a recall for the white MacBook, specifically for replacing the notebook&rsquo;s bottom part. This part, made of rubber, had a tendency to peel off due to the heat generated by the computer.</p>
<p>In the United States, MacBook users had the option to either take their computer to an Apple Store for a replacement of the bottom part or request to have the replacement part delivered to their homes for self-installation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this was not the case in Brazil. At that time, Apple did not have physical stores in Brazil, only the online Apple Store, and technical support was exclusively available through authorized stores.</p>
<p>I visited a couple of authorized stores in my city, where I was informed that I would need to leave the computer with them for a month. This duration was required for them to request, receive, and replace the part.</p>
<p>I decided to contact the Apple Store directly, explaining that leaving the notebook at an authorized store for an entire month was not feasible. However, I was informed that this was the standard procedure for Apple&rsquo;s relationship with authorized stores in Brazil—they were required to retain the device during the repair process.</p>
<p>The laptop wasn&rsquo;t mine; it belonged to my wife, who was working on her Ph.D. thesis. Under no circumstances could we afford to leave her computer at a store for an extended period.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I sent an email to Tim Cook, explaining the situation. I mentioned that in the US, a recall was in place, and they were sending replacement parts for self-installation, whereas in Brazil, we were required to leave the essential computer my wife needed to complete her studies in an authorized store for an entire month. I signed the email with my name and phone number.</p>
<p>I was mentally prepared to be ignored.</p>
<p>A few hours later, I received a call from Apple, from a representative who worked for the Vice President of Retail for Latin America. It was a brief call; they didn&rsquo;t inquire much and stated, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling to resolve your problem.&rdquo; They didn&rsquo;t say they would attempt to resolve it; they asserted they would indeed resolve it. I surmised that individuals at this level do not waste time; they take actions. All they asked of me was to pick the nearest authorized store to my home, where the replacement part would be delivered. They also assured me that once the part arrived, the store would call me to arrange for its replacement.</p>
<p>A week later, I received a call from the authorized store and proceeded to their location. The replacement part was installed right at the store&rsquo;s counter. An employee at the store asked, &ldquo;How did you manage to persuade Apple to send us the replacement part?&rdquo; To which I replied, &ldquo;I emailed Tim Cook.&rdquo; They probably found it hard to believe, but it worked. Ultimately, that&rsquo;s all that matters.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/09/13/micropublish.html">Micro.publish 2.0.0</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/09/13/micropublish.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-09-13 12:28:46 &#43;0100">Sep 13, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Starting from version 2.0.0, it is possible to update a post that was previously composed and published via <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.publish</a>.</p>
<p>Before diving into the specifics of this feature, it&rsquo;s important to mention a few design decisions that were made in order to implement this functionality.</p>
<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> conforms to the <a href="https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/">Micropub protocol</a>, which outlines the procedures for publishing notes, uploading images, assigning categories, saving bookmarks, and updating posts.</p>
<p>When updating a post, the protocol requires the inclusion of the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original post&rsquo;s <code>URL</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>blogID</code>, especially relevant for users managing multiple blogs.</li>
<li>The updated <code>content</code> and/or <code>title</code> of the post.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obsidian offers plugins developers the option to locally store data within the vault. However, this capability is limited and necessitates custom implementation. For this reason, it was decided to store the published post&rsquo;s <code>URL</code> within the Obsidian note itself using YAML frontmatter (and the new Properties feature). This approach ensures that the information remains readily accessible and easily modifiable if necessary.</p>
<h2 id="version-200">Version 2.0.0</h2>
<p>For posts <strong>published with version 2.0.0 or newer</strong>, the post&rsquo;s <code>URL</code> will be added to the Markdown file in the YAML frontmatter/Property.</p>
<p>For those in <em>Edit mode</em>, it appears as a Property as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="https://otavio.cc/uploads/2023/properties.png" alt="Properties"></p>
<p>And for those utilizing the <em>Source mode</em>, as YAML:</p>
<p><img src="https://otavio.cc/uploads/2023/frontmatter.png" alt="Frontmatter"></p>
<p>Once the note or title has been edited (either through the filename or <a href="https://micropublish.blog/properties">YAML/Property</a>), updating is as simple as using the <a href="https://micropublish.blog/publishing"><em>Post to Micro.blog</em> command from the Command Palette</a>. A simplified version of the Review view will appear, displaying the post&rsquo;s title. For users with multiple blogs, it will prompt them to confirm which blog the post belongs to.</p>
<p><img src="https://otavio.cc/uploads/2023/reviewedit.png" alt="Review/Edit"></p>
<h2 id="editing-posts-from-previous-versions">Editing posts from previous versions</h2>
<p>It is also possible to update posts that were <strong>published using Micro.publish versions prior to 2.0.0</strong>. To do so, you must include a Property (or field in the YAML frontmatter) named <code>url</code> containing the URL of the published post, as illustrated below.</p>
<p>To include a new Property, simply follow these steps in the Command Palette:</p>
<p><img src="https://otavio.cc/uploads/2023/add-property.png" alt="Add Property"></p>
<p>And add the <code>url</code> with the published post URL:</p>
<p><img src="https://otavio.cc/uploads/2023/properties.png" alt="Properties"></p>
<p>Those who prefer the YAML file can add the the <code>url</code> using the format:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#447fcf;text-decoration:underline">---</span><span style="color:#666">
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#666"></span><span style="color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold">url</span>:<span style="color:#666"> </span>https://example.com/path/to/post.html<span style="color:#666">
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#666"></span><span style="color:#447fcf;text-decoration:underline">---</span><span style="color:#666">
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>After editing the note or title (either through the filename or YAML/Property), updating is as straightforward as utilizing the <em>Post to Micro.blog</em> command from the Command Palette. Similar to the process for version 2.0.0, a simplified version of the Review view will be presented, featuring the post&rsquo;s title. For users with multiple blogs, it will inquire about the blog to which the post should be associated.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been working on version 2.0.0 of <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.publish</a>, which will introduce the <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/09/09/posting-and-updating.html">ability to edit Micro.blog posts</a> originally composed and published through <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. I&rsquo;ve managed to allocate a small fraction of my daily time to this project, and progress has been quite promising. I already have it functioning, and I&rsquo;m currently in the testing phase before releasing it.</p>
<p>I made a change in my online presence, deleting my old Matrix account, which had been lying dormant, and creating a new one using the <a href="http://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> server.</p>
<p>Also part of the recent changes, I decided to remove Bluesky from my phone and disabled cross-posting to <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://nostr.com/">Nostr</a>. I&rsquo;ll continue cross-posting to <a href="https://social.lol/@otaviocc">Mastodon</a> but have enabled the &ldquo;Automated Post Deletion&rdquo; feature for posts older than one week. In the case of Bluesky, I went ahead and deleted all of my posts there.</p>
<p>I went on a trip to Lithuania for our <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/09/08/team-offsite.html">Apple Team off-site</a>. We spent our time in cabins in the countryside, and the remarkable thing about our getaway was that work was the only topic we deliberately avoided. During my stay, I made the most of the picturesque setting to capture numerous photos.</p>
<p>When returning home, I was warmly welcomed by <em>scientist</em> and <em>tinyScientist</em> at the airport. <em>tinyScientist</em> seemed frozen at first when he saw me, but quickly jumped into my arms once we reunited.</p>
<p>Last but not least, exciting news, <em>tinyScientist</em> just sprouted his very first tooth!</p>

			 <p>Every now and then, we organize an off-site event for our entire Apple Team. Since our team members are based in different countries, coming together is a fantastic opportunity to foster stronger connections.</p>
<p>On this occasion, we rented cabins in the Lithuanian countryside. We spent our time there engaging in various activities such as playing cards, tabletop games, soccer, basketball, as well as enjoying some drinks and delicious food.</p>
<p>Our group consisted of over 30 people, including Product Owners, Engineering Managers, Team Leads, Software Engineers, and Quality Assurance.</p>
<p>Obviously, I dedicated some time to taking photos. Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t have my Fujifilm X100V with me, so I had to use my iPhone. The pictures are unedited and captured using the <a href="https://ritchiecam.com/">RitchieCam</a> app, following the SOOC (Straight Out of Camera) approach.</p>

			 <p>Earlier this week, I published <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.publish 1.7.0</a>, which introduces support for YAML frontmatter/Properties for titles and tags. I am so happy with all the feedback I received and all the coffees I was gifted!</p>
<p>I renewed my subscription to <a href="https://obsidian.md/sync">Obsidian Sync</a>. I had canceled it a while ago, but I realized that Obsidian is the best solution for note-taking and syncing notes between different devices. I need my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a> on both my personal and work devices.</p>
<p>We took <em>tinyScientist</em> to two doctor&rsquo;s appointments this week. The first was a routine checkup with the pediatrician, and the second was a follow-up appointment with a specialist (related to the surgery he had earlier this year). <em>tinyScientist</em> is doing well!</p>
<p>I am very particular about color schemes and wallpapers, but this week I found the perfect wallpaper for <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/09/01/i-have-found.html">my computer</a> and <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/08/31/found-the-perfect.html">phone</a>.</p>
<p>I also updated several entries in my Digital Garden:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.publish</a></li>
<li><a href="https://micropublish.blog/changelog/">Micro.publish Changelog</a></li>
<li><a href="https://otavio.cc/unit-testing/">Unit Testing With Doubles and Fixtures</a></li>
<li><a href="https://otavio.cc/pair-programming-tdd-rotation/">Pair Programming, TDD, and Rotation?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>and the <a href="https://github.com/otaviocc/obsidian-microblog">Micro.publish page on GitHub</a>, which is the content displayed in Obsidian&rsquo;s <em>Community Plugins</em> section.</p>
<p>I received some very sad news that my favorite barista in the city passed away suddenly. Not only was her coffee amazing, but she was also a wonderful person. She always treated <em>tinyScientist</em> very well, and he loved her.</p>
<p>Last but not least, it was my work anniversary. I have been with Nord Security (<a href="https://nordvpn.com/">NordVPN</a>) for two years now. Every year, we receive a gift from the company, and this year I got a baseball cap with the NordVPN logo on it.</p>

			 <p>I had to brave the German bureaucracy and visit the post office to mail a letter. It&rsquo;s not the most exciting way to spend a Saturday morning, but it&rsquo;s necessary sometimes.</p>
<p>I renewed my local library card for just €10/year. It&rsquo;s an amazing deal, considering that it gives me access to physical and digital books, audiobooks, magazines, newspapers, and more. I&rsquo;m especially excited about the <a href="https://www.manton.org/2023/06/21/good-morning-libby.html">new feature in Micro.blog</a> that lets me connect my Libby account and import my bookshelves. Perfect timing!</p>
<p>Yesterday I published a <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/08/12/reading-services.html">post about reading services</a>, and I decided to go back to using Readwise&rsquo;s Reader as both a read-later service and RSS feed client. I canceled my Feedbin subscription because Readwise&rsquo;s Reader saves me time by letting me access all of my content in one place.</p>
<p>I consolidated my photos from my photoblog to my blog and deleted the photoblog. I wrote a little bit about it <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/08/02/at-the-same.html">here</a> and <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/08/02/i-created-a.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/08/08/apple-music-launches.html">Apple&rsquo;s new Discovery Station</a> has been a pleasant surprise. I&rsquo;ve found a few new songs that I really like, and even the songs that I haven&rsquo;t been crazy about have been interesting enough to keep me listening.</p>
<p>I deleted my Wolt account again, but this time I&rsquo;m determined to stick to my decision. Wolt makes it too easy to be lazy and order food, and the costs can add up quickly.</p>
<p>I love the <a href="https://glass.photo">Glass.photo</a> community, so I was excited to see that they introduced a new subscription tier called Patron. Patron offers a variety of benefits, including app customizations, access to new features, and three 1-year accounts to share with family and friends. I subscribed as soon as I saw <a href="https://glass.photo/highlights/introducing-patron">their post</a>. My home screen loves the new icons.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just started watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_All_Mankind_(TV_series)">For All Mankind</a>, and I&rsquo;m really enjoying it so far. I&rsquo;ve only watched half season, but it&rsquo;s already clear that this is a well-made show. I&rsquo;m excited to see where the story goes next.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using Passkeys on GitHub, Google, omg.lol, and rad.dad. It&rsquo;s a shame that Passage, 1Password&rsquo;s passkey solution for websites, doesn&rsquo;t support <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">YubiKeys</a> yet.</p>
<p>Discord is <a href="https://discord.com/blog/usernames">rolling out changes to usernames</a>, removing the four-digit discriminator. As a non-Nitro subscriber, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting to be able to claim my username so soon. Anyway, I’m <code>otaviocc</code> there.</p>

			 <p>TL;DR: I&rsquo;m using Readwise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>👨‍💻 I’m a happy Feedbin user, but recently I feel I’m constantly switching between Reeder, app I use to access Feedbin, and Readwise’s Reader. I’m gonna give Reader’s feed feature a chance for a week and see how it goes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weeks ago, I <a href="https://otavio.cc/about/">decided</a> to try <a href="https://readwise.io/">Readwise</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Reader</a> as an RSS feed reader for a week. I felt I was spending too much time going back and forth between <a href="https://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a> and Reader, sometimes having to copy and paste URLs manually.</p>
<p>After a few weeks of using Readwise&rsquo;s RSS feature, I decided it wasn&rsquo;t for me. Reader tries to be smart by fetching the content of the URL in the feed, instead of showing the content from the feed itself.</p>
<p>It tries to be smart because several websites return partial content in their RSS, but it often fails to fetch the content. This is especially true for microblogs.</p>
<p>So I decided to go back to Feedbin (using the app <a href="https://www.reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>) and use <a href="https://getpocket.com/saves">Pocket</a> as a read-later service (using Reeder and their official app). However, I quickly noticed that Pocket often fails to parse pages, and their new app doesn&rsquo;t have highlighting. So that was a no-go.</p>
<p>Next, I tried <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/u">Instapaper</a>. Instapaper is the first read-later app I ever used, decades ago, and it hasn&rsquo;t changed much since then. That&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing, since the app does exactly what I expect it to do. However, it does fail to parse some content, such as images and code blocks from pages and blogs I read often.</p>
<p>That brings me to <a href="https://hq.getmatter.com/">Matter</a>, which I&rsquo;m a patron of. Matter offers the best overall experience of all the apps I&rsquo;ve tried. The website is beautifully made, the apps are native, and the colors and typography are lovely. However, it also often fails to parse content, redirecting me to the original website instead.</p>
<p>Matter has the best customer service of all the apps I&rsquo;ve tried. As soon as you report something to them, they quickly fix the content.</p>
<p>As Readwise&rsquo;s Reader, Matter also supports RSS feeds. And like Readwise, it tries to be smart and parse the content from the URL instead of using the content already in the feed.
I&rsquo;ve noticed that Matter&rsquo;s RSS feature often fails to retrieve the content of the page, redirecting me to the original URL, as it does when saving an article to the Queue. Sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t show an item from the RSS at all. It simply ignores the post without any explanation.</p>
<p>Long story short, after several tests and setups, <strong>I&rsquo;m back to Readwise&rsquo;s Reader</strong>. It&rsquo;s the most stable of all the setups I&rsquo;ve tried, even though it isn&rsquo;t pretty and sometimes fails trying to be smart. It also isn&rsquo;t native, which causes some weird glitches. But it works most of the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still a patron of Matter and will keep it installed on my devices, using it every now and then to follow its progress. But for now, Readwise&rsquo;s Reader is the one on my main screen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple Music has a new station that’s designed to help you find songs you might like. The app’s Discovery Station will play a curated selection of music based on what you’ve been listening to lately but haven’t added to your library or heard before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The feature I missed the most when I switched from Spotify to Apple Music was the Discover Weekly. At some point Spotify&rsquo;s recommendations were so good that I would spend the week just listening to the Discover Weekly and nothing else.</p>

<p>Passage currently only supports platform authenticators and not roaming authenticators, such as Yubikeys. This is because platform authenticators (TouchID, FaceID, etc) are much more prevalent among consumers and disabling roaming authenticators provides a better user experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s a real bummer. It&rsquo;s true TouchID and FaceID are widespread, but I like to use two keys as backup (and for work related stuff).</p>

<p>The last notes I wrote are from <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/05/07/no-highlights-this.html">Week 2023-18</a>, and so many things happened since that post that I won&rsquo;t even try to remember all the details. Instead, I&rsquo;ll focus in some of the highlights.</p>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p><em>tinyScientist</em> had his first surgery and had to stay in hospital for almost a week for recovery.</p>
<p>The surgery took seven hours, from the first incision to the last stitch, according to the doctors, followed by another two hours in post-anesthesia recovery. An eternity if you ask us. But we were waiting and preparing for this day since the fourth month of pregnancy, having monthly appointments with doctors and midwife to talk about the surgery, steps for before and after, etc…</p>
<p>The surgery was a success, and <em>tinyScientist</em> is recovering well. He was exhausted and bored during the week he had to stay hospitalized, but that&rsquo;s all in the past now.</p>
<p>To celebrate I asked <a href="https://ko-fi.com/andycarolan/commissions">Andy Carolan</a> to create profile pictures for the family. They&rsquo;re all awesome, but <em>tinyScientist</em>&rsquo;s is a piece of art.</p>
<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2>
<p>Watched two movies recently, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons:_Honor_Among_Thieves">Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Super_Mario_Bros._Movie">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>.</p>
<p>I was skeptical about <strong>D&amp;D</strong>, but loved the movie. The balance between humor, action, and luck is perfect. Great easter eggs as well!</p>
<p><strong>Super Mario</strong> is fun, good entertainment. I don’t understand why people were complaining about it. It’s a kids movie, what were they expecting?</p>
<h2 id="playing">Playing</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda%3A_Tears_of_the_Kingdom">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> was released the day my son had his surgery. On the day before - thanks Amazon! - I got the standard version and on the release day I got the Collector’s Edition.</p>
<p>The days after the surgery were extremely busy and I didn’t find time to play it, but this week I finally did. What can I say? It’s even better than the best game ever made (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>).</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I love a good dystopian story, and when I saw the trailer for <a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/originals/silo/">Silo</a> I decided to buy the <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780358447825">The Silo Saga</a> to read.</p>
<h2 id="hacking">Hacking</h2>
<h3 id="micropublish">Micro.publish</h3>
<p>A user reported that <a href="https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=micro.publish">Micro.publish</a> allowed to run the publish command with an empty post, resulting in error since Micro.blog doesn’t support empty posts (obviously).</p>
<p>So I released a minor update - 1.6.0 - fixing it. After the change, users will be prompted with a message saying they have to write something before publishing into Micro.blog.</p>
<p>I’ve also updated the <em>donate</em> button inside the Plug-in to use <a href="https://ko-fi.com/otaviocc">Ko-fi</a> instead of <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/otaviocc">BuyMeACoffee</a>. I like that platform better.</p>
<h3 id="omglol">omg.lol</h3>
<p>I’m back working on my <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> client for macOS. Didn’t put much time on it, but was using and testing the app to make sure it looks good for releasing it.</p>
<h3 id="appnet-import">App.net import</h3>
<p><a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/06/02/appnet-archive-migrated.html">Quickly wrote a script</a> to download all my App.net posts and published them as a <a href="https://otavio.cc/adn/">page in my blog</a>. I might, someday, import those posts as regular posts in this blog, but for now I&rsquo;ll keep them in a separate page.</p>

<p>I’m on <strong>Bluesky</strong>, this new social network created by another billionaire. I don’t have plans to create content there, my focus is, and always will be, <strong>Micro.blog</strong>. The plan is to <em>cross-post</em> what I write on my blog there, as I already do with <strong>Mastodon</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bluesky</strong>: <code>@otavio.cc</code></li>
<li><strong>Mastodon</strong>: <code>@otaviocc@social.lol</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I canceled <strong>Obsidian Sync</strong> and <strong>Obsidian Publish</strong>. The service is really good, but I’m not it’s worth the price for my needs.  <code>git</code> works just fine for me.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>Monday is the day with most of my meetings, retrospective, pre-planning, planning, syncs with other teams, etc… But this time I attended all from home. I’m avoiding working from the office until <em>tinyScientist</em>’s surgery.</p>
<p>Tuesday I took a day off to talk to doctors about <em>tinyScientist</em>’ surgery. And the rest of the week was just business as usual.</p>
<h2 id="hacking">Hacking</h2>
<p>I wasn’t planning on starting another feature in my <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> client before releasing it to the public, but recently I started using <strong>Pastebin</strong> more and more and thought it would be a good idea to implement it in my client.</p>
<p>On Monday I worked on the <code>PastebinNetworkService</code>, responsible for the network requests for the feature.</p>
<p>Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday I didn’t have time to work on the project, but on Friday I started the <code>PastebinPersistencekService</code>, responsible for persisting the snippets locally on Core Data.</p>
<h2 id="gaming">Gaming</h2>
<p>The reason I didn’t have much time to work on my app has a name: <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/cult-of-the-lamb-switch/">Cult of the Lamb</a>.</p>
<h2 id="photography">Photography</h2>
<p><a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/04/18/week.html">Two weeks ago I traveled to Turkey</a> for the company Workation and didn’t take my camera with me. I knew I would miss the opportunity to take amazing photos, but I wanted to pack light, using a single backpack. So, I challenged myself to take RAW photos using my iPhone instead.</p>
<p>Everything I know about RAW is theoretical. I don’t shoot RAW and don’t know how to edit or “develop” photos of this format.</p>
<p>I have <a href="https://www.darkroom.co/">Darkroom</a> instead on my devices, because I bought the life-time license a long time ago, and decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>Darkroom is magical. All the controls and features are so intuitive I was impressed by the results. I even created a Preset for me, so that I can apply the same look and feel to other “similar” photos.</p>
<p>Will I use RAW on my camera? No. My Fujifilm camera is for SOOC photos only, but I might start shooting RAW more often on the phone.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not using any plugin to maintain a Digital Garden on Micro.blog. It would require a lot of transformation (file paths, dealing with file names, etc&hellip;) and I don&rsquo;t have much time now to put into a new plugin. For now it&rsquo;s all manually maintained.</p>

<p><a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/04/18/week.html">Last week</a> I arrived from the Workation on Sunday, and stayed at home most of the week. The first time I left home this week was on Thursday.</p>
<p>Just to be on the safe side, I took several COVID-19 tests. <em>tinyScientist</em>’s surgery is less than a month from now, and we want to protect him from any sort of cold or flu.</p>
<p>We were planning to take him to the zoo on Saturday to see the lions, but it was one of those rare sunny days, so the zoo was probably packed with kids, better to avoid it a while longer.</p>
<p>Decided to walk in the city instead, found a park that’s open enough, and took tons of pictures. Also, coffee…</p>

			 <h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>Another short week in Germany 🇩🇪. On Monday, we had a holiday, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Monday">Easter Monday</a>, and, as the day was beautiful, we took <em>tinyScientist</em> to a park. It was his first time on a swing (for babies), and he loved it!</p>
<p>I like visiting different places, but I hate traveling. A simple 3-hour flight means a whole day of preparations, trains, airport, security checks, etc… but we don’t have teleportation yet, so…</p>
<h2 id="working-vacationing-hacking-partying">Working? Vacationing? Hacking? Partying?</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This week we had our Workation and almost all of <a href="https://nordsecurity.com/">Nord Security</a> traveled to a resort in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey">Turkey</a> 🇹🇷; more than 1000 people flew from different parts of the World to our 2023 gathering. That’s not a typo, 10^3+ people traveled to our event…</p>
<h3 id="wednesday">Wednesday</h3>
<p>For me, it all started with a train ride to the airport. Although the airport is far from the city center, public transit works and the express train runs from the Hauptbahnhof to the airport terminal in about 20–25 minutes.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="thursday">Thursday</h3>
<p>We arrived at the resort around 2am after a long flight and bus ride from the Antalya airport to the hotel. The main restaurant and bar are open until 6am, so after checking in, we headed there for dinner.</p>
<p>I missed the city tour in the morning, I was exhausted and barely remember turning off the alarm. I woke up around 10am for a late breakfast, followed by a visit to the Sea. And then back for lunch.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There’s an hour time difference between Antalya and Germany, so after lunch I FaceTimed home to watch <em>tinyScientist</em> having his lunch.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I worked on my <a href="https://omg.lol/">omg.lol</a> for macOS with the most amazing view, and spent the rest of the day chatting with folks from work. Implemented the <code>WebpageNetworkService</code> for the Webpage feature, responsible for all the network calls.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After dinner, I went to my room to FaceTime scientist and <em>tinyScientist</em> again.</p>
<h3 id="friday">Friday</h3>
<p>On Thursday, I went to bed around 9 or 10 pm, planning to wake up earlier on Friday to see the sunrise. I got up around 5:30 am, packed my things and walked to the private beach. Since almost everyone was partying on the night before, I was the only one on the beach in the morning.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Once I was done taking pictures, I sat in a chair, listening to the Mediterranean Sea (and some birds). Priceless. I can’t remember when was the last time I did something like this. Good thing my AirPods Pro had no juice.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another good reason to wake up early: breakfast before everyone else. I didn’t make healthier choices and ate scrambled eggs, egg with vegetables and boiled potatoes.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I spent the rest of the morning socializing with teammates until lunch, which I skipped. The good thing is that all restaurants in the hotel are open 24/7, so having a late lunch is not a problem.</p>
<p>I found time to do some more work on my <a href="https://omg.lol/">omg.lol</a> client. Implemented the <code>WebpagePersistenceService</code> and the <code>WebpageRepository</code>. The first responsible for storing the webpage (and history of changes) on Core Data, and the latter the abstraction on top of the network and persistence services. The glue.</p>
<p>Found a Starbucks inside the resort, next to one of the pools. Since this is an all-inclusive resort, Starbucks is also included. Perfect for cold drinks next to the beach or a pool.</p>
<p>At 4pm, we had our Q1 OKRs meeting with the entire company, followed by dinner and the OKR party. The OKR meeting was the only work part of the workation.</p>
<p>But before the party, I finished the Webpage Feature implementation and can now update <a href="https://otavio.lol/">otavio.lol</a> using it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="saturday">Saturday</h3>
<p>I intended to take more pictures of the sun rising, but I overslept and woke up at 6:30. At that time, the sun was already out there, so I went straight to breakfast. Omelet, bread, and cheese.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And then headed out to my favorite spot in the whole resort.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Implemented the SwiftUI previews for the Webpage UI and then joined some folks from my team by one of the pools, drinking an Iced Coffee Americano from the hotel’s Starbucks.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I felt guilt for my food choices and decided to eat better during lunch.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After lunch, I must have coffee, so I did. After grabbing another Starbucks, I took the opportunity to walk the resort a bit and found this cat – one of many cats that live in the hotel – staring at me.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I spent the rest of the day with my team, chatting and having dinner and some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklavas</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When the party started, I went to my room to talk to scientist and <em>tinyScientist</em>, pack my bag, and sleep.</p>
<h3 id="sunday">Sunday</h3>
<p>Homecoming day. I woke up early again, and had a nice walk on the beach, followed by a long, unhealthy breakfast. Our bus was scheduled to leave for the airport at lunchtime, so I might have eaten more than needed to make up for the lunch I was about to miss.</p>
<p>Spent the morning with the folks from the team and left the resort to visit some shops and buy souvenirs and Turkish tea to take back home. My bag was already packed from the day before, but I had to take everything out and repack it to make room for the tea set I bought.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I traveled with a single backpack (a big one, the limit for taking on the cabin), but after putting the tea set in it, it weighed about 10 kg. The limit is 8 kg, and I was afraid someone would weight it at the airport, but no one did, so it was fine.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I was so exhausted I didn’t feel the trip home. It was almost like teleportation finally existed. The workation was spectacular, something I’ve never done before, but it’s good to be back home. I missed scientist and <em>tinyScientist</em>, and seeing them again was a relief. The day ended with us giving <em>tinyScientist</em> a bath.</p>

<p><em>tinyScientist</em> got a new bed. They grow so fast!</p>
<p>After using so many <strong>Read Later</strong> services in the last decade, I believe I can finally stop looking for the right one for me. <a href="https://read.readwise.io/later">Readwise&rsquo;s Read</a> works the way I need a Read Later app to work. Both their apps, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/readwise/id1476885528">Readwise</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/readwise-reader/id1567599761">Read</a>, have performance and UX issues, but they work, deliver what they promise, and are always improving. I was skeptical with all those YouTube videos praising the service, but I decided to give it a try and am impressed.</p>
<p>Last week I migrated all my personal notes from <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> to <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a>, but maybe I was too eager to try Bear&rsquo;s update that I rushed things. Thinking again, Obsidian (and some other apps) offer something Bear doesn&rsquo;t: access to the notes without having to use the their app. Obsidian uses simple <a href="https://commonmark.org/">Markdown</a> files in the file system, while Bear stores all notes and assets in a <em>sqlite</em> database, hidden away from the user.</p>
<p>Portability is an important thing nowadays, especially with so many apps hiding their features behind subscriptions. With simple Markdown files I can edit my notes with anything, including my beloved <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>Another short week at work, 7th of April was the first day of Easter (Good Friday). But I went to the office twice, on Monday and Wednesday, for 1-on-1s with the folks from my team, to support them with their Development Plans.</p>
<h2 id="hacking">Hacking</h2>
<p>I had plans to work on the Webpage Feature of my native <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> client for macOS, but decided to work a little bit on <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.publish</a>, my Obsidian plugin to post to Micro.blog.</p>
<p>Readwise&rsquo;s plugin for Obsidian automatically fetches highlights and notes when Obsidian launches, so I decided to do the same for Micro.blog categories. Now, when the user opens Obsidian, it fetches the categories one has on their blogs.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The command to force fetch categories is still present and can be used at any time to retrieve categories (e.g., in case new categories were added directly to Micro.blog while Obsidian was open).</p>
<p>Another feature I&rsquo;ve added is the ability to schedule a post for a future date. I usually don&rsquo;t scheduled my posts, but it&rsquo;s a nice feature to have.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve also updated <a href="https://otavio.cc/">my blog</a>&rsquo;s colors to match the Obsidian dark theme I use, and used Xcode dark colors for the <a href="https://otavio.cc/mocks/">code snippets</a>. Feels much more natural to me now.</p>
<h2 id="photography">Photography</h2>
<p>During the week I published another page to my <a href="https://otavio.cc/kleingarten/">Digital Garden</a>, <a href="https://otavio.cc/obscura/">Obscura</a>, where I detail the setup I have to take Monochrome photos using the app.</p>
<p>Later during the week I updated the page to include the missing piece in my setup, which was causing Glass not to show the EXIF of my photos.</p>
<p>After talking to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@BenRiceM">Ben</a>, Software Engineer behind Obscura, we found what was missing, and now my setup is exactly the way I wanted it to be: Monochrome photos by default, saving JPEG SOOC, and with EXIF preserved, ready to share online (or not).</p>

<p><em>tinyScientist</em> is officially six months old. I was browsing some of his early pictures and it’s crazy how much things have changed in such a short time. This week he tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsnip">Parsnip</a> and Potato. He loved the first, but didn’t enjoy the latter that much. Pumpkin is still this favorite.</p>
<p>Browsing <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/en-de">Disney+</a> I found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devs">Devs</a>, a Hulu TV Show I had no idea existed. It&rsquo;s an 8-episode miniseries about <em>free will</em> and <em>determinism</em> where <a href="https://nickofferman.co/">Nick Offerman</a> runs a tech company with quantum technology to&hellip; It doesn&rsquo;t matter, it&rsquo;s Nick Offerman. Interesting show, watched the entire thing.</p>
<p>Last week Bear <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bearapp/comments/11xlgxs/the_bear_2_beta_is_here/">released Bear 2 Beta on TestFlight</a> and, as a big Bear fan, I downloaded it to try. The editor was rebuilt from scratch, adding features users were asking for a long time. One of my favorite features is <em>backlinks</em>, something all <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> users know well. Currently Bear supports <code>[[WikiLinks]]</code>, allowing one to link another note (as Obsidian does), but the new version implements <em>backlinks</em>, showing which pages link the one selected. It also shows pages that mention the page but don&rsquo;t link them (<em>Unlinked Mention</em>). This is big! I exported all my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a> notes from Obsidian and imported on Bear and will use it for now on. And it&rsquo;s a native application, and I’m a sucker for good native applications.</p>
<p>I’m using <a href="https://arc.net/">Arc</a> from <a href="https://thebrowser.company/">The Browser Company</a> as default browser in my work computer for a few months, and I’m loving it. The way the tabs are managed, the different spaces, and profiles, the pinned tabs, etc… I’m the kind of person who can’t handle multiple tabs open at the same time, quickly getting lost in a see of tiny <em>favicons</em>. Arc changed that completely, I can easily keep several sites open simultaneously and, more importantly, find my way in it.</p>
<p>Thursday <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEE8GhLy6U4">Arc released Arc for iPhone</a>. It’s not a browser but a <em>bookmark</em> manager. It gives access to Spaces, Easel, and Notes one has on their computer. And offers the ability to create new tabs by importing URLs from other apps via the iOS’ share sheet. Still not sure how useful it is; time will tell.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>Most of the time I work from home, but if there&rsquo;s a day I like to go to the office, this day is Monday. It&rsquo;s the day I have most of my meetings (Retrospective, Planning, 1-on-1s), and it&rsquo;s the day the kitchen is restocked. Big day.</p>
<p>On Wednesday we had a public <a href="https://nordvpn.com/meshnet/">Meshnet</a> Meetup, open to the community where the team talked about the feature and technical details and concepts on networking and how the whole architecture was designed and built. My <a href="https://nordvpn.com/download/mac/">macOS team</a> works on Meshnet, and I’m happy to see the company promoting and talking about what we’re building openly. We even released <a href="https://github.com/NordSecurity/libtelio">some</a> of the <a href="https://github.com/NordSecurity/libdrop">libraries</a> as open source software. And, as in most meetups, tons of pizza and beer.</p>
<p>During March I experienced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-day_workweek">4-day workweeks</a>, but this week I had two days off, Thursday and Friday. Finally used all my vacation days from 2022.</p>
<h2 id="hacking">Hacking</h2>
<p>I finished the Now Pages support on my <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> app for macOS. The implementation allows the user to update their Now Pages and keeps a history of previous edits, in case the user wants to roll back a version.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Additionally, I&rsquo;ve added a way to share the Now Page as a Status in the Statuslog.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next week I plan to add the Webpage feature, so that users can edit their pages. Once that’s done, I will decide on how to release the application. I don’t know if Open Source or not, if AppStore or direct download (as <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> and <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a>). But I want to get it out before implementing the blog support, which will be a bit more complex.</p>

			 <p>Earlier this week I deleted another internet account: <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>.</p>
<p>We - <a href="https://nordsecurity.com/">Nord Security</a> - hosted the <strong>CocoaHead Berlin</strong> on Wednesday. It was great, full house, and we had too speakers from Nord Security. Bob from <a href="https://nordlocker.com/">NordLocker</a> talked about SwiftUI and Ieva from <a href="https://nordvpn.com/">NordVPN</a> about <a href="https://fastlane.tools/">fastlane</a>, screenshot automation and the iOS strategy to inject mock data for App Store screenshots.</p>
<p>Speaking of work, on Thursday I had a long training on Leadership (and Management) at the company. Earlier this year I got a new title/role, going from <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> to <strong>Engineering Team Lead</strong>, which means I’m half of the time Software Engineer and the other half Engineering Manager. It’s a brand new world to me, so I went back home exhausted. There’s a lot to process.</p>
<p>On Friday I had another day off, still taking 2022 vacation days before the end of March (German regulations, vacation days from a given year have to be spent before end of March of the following year). I took <em>tinyScientist</em> to a coffee shop around 9am, where <em>we</em> had coffee with a friend and talked about iOS and macOS development, leadership and management, and layoffs. <em>tinyScientist</em> got bored with all the talk and decided to take a nap in his <em>kinderwagen</em>.</p>
<p>In the previous weeks I finished two features of my <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> native client: <em>Statuslog</em> and <em>PURLs</em>, and during this week I started working on the <strong>Now Page</strong>. I still don’t know how I’m gonna distribute the app, if via AppStore, or directly for download as NetNewWire and Micro.blog do. Same goes for pricing, I still haven’t decided if it’ll be a paid app or not.</p>
<p>Finally, the most important thing which happened during the week: <em>tinyScientist</em> <strong>had his first <em>solid</em> meal</strong>. We were not expecting him to eat (we thought he would only play with the food), but he loved pumpkin. As result, he had pumpkin four days in a row for lunch.</p>

			 <p>On Tuesday I returned from a 10-day vacation, and on Friday I had another day off. In Germany there’s no carry over from one year to another, and the deadline to spend the vacation days from the previous year is end of March. As I still have vacation days from 2022 that I’m <em>forced</em> to take, I’m taking all the Fridays off until the end of the Month.</p>
<p>During the week we took <em>tinyScientist</em> to the doctor to do some extra tests he’ll for his surgery. We’re excited for him, but anxious as hell. I have faith in Science and in the doctors here. The support he’s getting from them is spectacular.</p>
<p>After months waiting for <em>tinyScientist</em>’s <a href="https://otavio.cc/child-benefits-in-germany/">Kindergeld</a>, it has finally arrived. Bureaucracy in Germany is a big thing, but at the end everything works as expected.</p>
<p>Last weekend I finished the modular architecture for my <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> client for macOS. The first feature I built while working in the architecture was the <em>Statuslog</em>. During the week, with just a few hours here and there I added <em>PURLs</em>. It’s a good indicator the modular architecture is a success. My goal was to achieve full decoupling in a way it should be easy to extend the application and add new features.</p>
<p>I started playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopath_Traveler_II">Octopath Traveler II</a>. The first game was amazing, and I ordered the second game as soon as they started selling it.</p>

			 <p><strong>Braille Institute</strong> released a font for low vision readers, <a href="https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont">Atkinson Hyperlegible</a>. The font is great and I asked <a href="https://web.getmatter.com/list/queue">Matter</a> to add it to their list of supported fonts. Matter accepted my requested and within a couple of hours they deployed the changes. I’ve update <a href="https://otavio.cc/">my blog</a> to use Atkinson Hyperlegible as well.</p>
<p>I keep going back-and-forth between Reminders and <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>. Every time there&rsquo;s a new macOS version I go back to Reminders to see what changed. But the truth is, Things is an amazing app and I decided to go back to it. The best of all, I can synchronize Things on all the computers I use, no matter if they’re using the same Apple ID or not. Reminders use iCloud, so I’m limited to the Apple ID I’m using. The downside is that I had to pay for Things twice.</p>
<p>Same goes for Safari and Firefox. I’m a big Firefox fan (since it was called Phoenix) and love the <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers">Multi-Account Containers</a> feature, but Safari is so much faster and has better support for physical keys and Apple Pay so I keep going back to it.</p>
<p>I read a review about <a href="https://readkit.app/">ReadKit</a> and decided to give it a try. I deleted Reeder from my devices to force myself to use it. The application is actually nice and I’m enjoying it a lot. I like the way it integrates with Pinboard as well, which is a service I use for about 15 years. It supports Smart Folders, a great feature when subscribing to tons of feeds.</p>
<p>Decided to create a <a href="https://otavio.cc/kleingarten/">mini Digital Garden</a> on Micro.blog. It&rsquo;s not perfect because I have to create all the links between pages manually. But at least all the content is hosted in my blog. I have to check if there&rsquo;s an API to post Pages on Micro.blog directly, and add an option to my <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.publish plugin</a> so that people can publish posts and pages from Obsidian. For now, the digital garden has notes about <a href="https://otavio.cc/unit-testing">Unit Testing</a>, <a href="https://otavio.cc/open-source">Open Source</a>, and <a href="https://otavio.cc/child-benefits-in-germany">Child Benefits in Germany</a>.</p>
<p>I released a minor change to <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.publish plugin</a>, including a link to my <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/otaviocc">Buy My a Coffee</a> page. I added a link to <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/otaviocc">Buy My a Coffee</a> in all my <a href="https://otavio.cc/kleingarten/">mini Digital Garden</a> pages as well.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re cat sitting for friends and I usually go to their house at night, after <em>tinyScientist</em> goes to bed. I&rsquo;m using my time there to work on my <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> native client for macOS and iOS. My client is fully modularized and each feature is a micro app on its own. Once all the setup is done, the app should scale pretty well, and adding new omg.lol features should be a breeze. I plan to write about <a href="https://otavio.cc/modularization/">Modularization</a> once the setup is finished.</p>
<p>I finally started playing <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/fire-emblem-engage-switch/">Fire Emblem Encore</a>, but already have my eyes on <strong>Metroid Prime Remastered</strong>. I must resist, in two weeks there’s <strong>Octopath Traveler II</strong> and in May, <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</strong>.</p>
<p>LEGO <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-minifigures-series-24-71037">Series 24</a> is complete. We went to a LEGO store and they had hundreds of minifigure bags. Spent a good amount of time there, <em>feeling</em> the bags and found the last two.</p>
<p>And finally, I had to use Twitter to talk to my ISP&rsquo;s support. Their service is too unstable and every now and then I have to contact them to complain (and ask for my money back). Maybe it&rsquo;s time to switch providers so that I don&rsquo;t have to use Twitter anymore.</p>

			 <p>For a couple of reasons I prefer to take photos in JPEG (but that’s a topic for a blog post). That’s what I do with my Fujifilm camera, but not with my iPhone. iOS enhances JPEG photos taken in low light conditions, destroying the mood. The “fix” is to shoot RAW. A real bummer.</p>

			 <p>Earlier this week I took my parents to the airport and had the opportunity to work on my side project on the train on my way back home. For some reason I enjoy coding on trains, buses, and airplanes. Especially when it’s raining outside. A wonderful combination of white noise sounds, I suppose.</p>
<p><em>tinyScientist</em> went to the doctor for his <em>U-Untersuchungen</em> and took some other vaccines. My wife has a Phd in vaccine development working with viruses, so of course <em>tinyScientist</em> won’t miss a single shot.</p>
<p>On Tuesday I returned to work after two weeks off and had my contract updated to match my new title: Engineering Team Lead. Never have I imagined I would take such kind of role, but the setup we have in the company works so well that I decided to accept the challenge. I’m glad I have the time to write code and lead a team.</p>
<p>Internet in Germany has its ups and downs; probably more downs than ups. This week my Internet Provider gave me money back because the service is too unstable in my area, I had to use my phone as personal hotspot in 30% of the meetings I attended.</p>
<p>Earlier this year LEGO released the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-minifigures-series-24-71037">Series 24</a> of its minifigures. We went to a store to <em>feel the packages</em>, as we always do, and found 10 minifigures. Still missing 2.</p>
<p>And finally, I canceled Audible. The local public library is great and offers thousands of audiobooks via <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby">Libby</a> for 10 EUR/year.</p>

			 <p>Obsidian is the <em>source of truth</em> for most of my writings<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and I though it would be interesting to post to <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> directly from it. In the past I explored several applications such as <a href="https://ulysses.app/">Ulysses</a>, <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>, and many others which allow publishing to Micro.blog, but they don&rsquo;t work for me, they don&rsquo;t reflect the way I think and take notes. Obsidian does.</p>
<p>So I searched on Micro.blog and found <a href="https://philbowell.me/2021/12/22/i-wonder-if.html">this post</a> from <a href="https://micro.blog/philbowell">@philbowell</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wonder if there is a way to post to Micro.blog from Obsidian. 🤔</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And nope, there isn&rsquo;t. So I took the challenge.</p>
<p>Obsidian isn&rsquo;t a native application and I can&rsquo;t remember when it was the last time I wrote something which isn&rsquo;t <em>compiled</em> to run on an specific architecture 👨‍💻, so I had to learn <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> and <code>npm</code>, and spent a good amount of time making <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> look pretty (stealing ideas from my friend <a href="https://atila.io/">Atila</a>).</p>
<p>Luckily for me, the TypeScript syntax isn&rsquo;t that different from Swift, so in a matter of hours I had something working. Since the Obsidian Plugin architecture is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a>, I decided to go with OOP using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel">MVVM</a>, without third-party dependencies to avoid taking unnecessary complexity into Obsidian.</p>
<p>The result of all this is <a href="https://github.com/otaviocc/obsidian-microblog">Micro.publish</a>, my Obsidian plugin to publish to Micro.blog. The plugin isn&rsquo;t available to install from Obsidian&rsquo;s <em>Community Plugins</em> yet since they review all the plugins there, but it&rsquo;s possible to install it directly from GitHub by following some manual steps.</p>
<p>Micro.publish has the features I need. It allows</p>
<ul>
<li>setting default tags</li>
<li>setting the default post visibility</li>
<li>setting a default blog (for those with more than one M.b blog)</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And before publishing, it&rsquo;s possible to override these default settings for the post being published.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>More features are planned, and will be coming soon.</p>

			 <p>First version of my <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> plugin for <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is ready 👨‍💻 Some feature are missing - as expected for a first release -, but I plan to add them in the future. E.g.,</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog selection</li>
<li>Set categories/tags</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently it allows users to</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the default post visibility for new posts</li>
<li>Set the post title</li>
<li>Open post, preview, and edit URLs after publishing the post</li>
</ul>
<p>The plugin can be found on <a href="https://github.com/otaviocc/obsidian-microblog">GitHub</a>. The next step is to submit it to Obsidian&rsquo;s <em>Community Plugins</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: The name isn&rsquo;t final since this is not an official Micro.blog product. I have to find a better name for it.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago I decided to get my leather tools in the cellar and make something. Since I have more than one pouch - a small one, and a bigger when I&rsquo;m carrying my Fuji - I decided to make something to put my pocket notebooks - which I also make -, cards, pocket knife, and flashlight. This way it&rsquo;s easier to move all my EDC from one pouch to another.</p>
<p>Leather work is fun, and for me it works for medidation or to listen to podcasts I need to focus on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the final result. Below the pocket knife and flashlight.</p>

			 <p>About a month ago I decided to build a new app to attend a personal need, a desktop client for <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>, a service I&rsquo;ve been using for over a decade to store and manage my bookmarks.</p>
<p>As any application which requires internet to fetch and update data, my client needed a way to detect network accessibility. For a long time the strategy adopted by engineers in this situation was to rely on Apple&rsquo;s Reachability class, a sample code the company used to provide for download on their developer portal. Well, either that or one of the many CocoaPods frameworks the community built to replace Apple&rsquo;s drag-and-drop solution. But since iOS 12.0 and macOS 10.14 there&rsquo;s a powerfull first-party alternative.</p>
<p>Introduced a couple of years ago, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpathmonitor"><code>NWPathMonitor</code></a> is the easiest way to detect network changes (and retrieve connection properties). Its interface is extremely simple to use, providing a callback to get notified of updates.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>SwiftUI and Combine are new to me, I spiked and re-implemented some UI components I have up in my sleeve, but nothing too complex. Building this client is helping me to explore and learn new APIs.</p>
<p>The protocols <code>Publisher</code>, <code>Subscriber</code>, and <code>Subscription</code> are examples of these APIs. To implement a custom publisher it&rsquo;s necessary to implement types conforming to two of these protocols.</p>
<p>First, a quick recap:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher"><code>Publisher</code></a> is the type which emits events over time,</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber/"><code>Subscriber</code></a> is the type which receives events published by the publisher, and</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscription"><code>Subscription</code></a> implements the link between publishers and subscribers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step was to define my publisher interface. Since the monitor requires a queue to run, I decided to pass the queue as argument. In order to simplify its interface, a background queue is passed by default to the implementation.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The interface provides a hint of the first type to be implemented, <code>NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher</code>. Most of the code is boilerplate, and for this publisher, the <code>Output</code> expected is <code>NWPath</code>, without a <code>Failure</code>.</p>
<p>When the publisher <em>receives</em> a subscriber, the link between them is established.</p>

			 <p>I strongly believe that the best way to learn something new is by experimenting and practicing it.</p>
<p>A few months ago I was studying <em>Functional Programming in Swift</em>. Swift is a modern, powerful, and safe language. Its syntax is so simple and elegant that it works as an invitation to dive into the Functional Programming world.</p>
<p>After practicing Functional Programming in Swift for a few weeks, I decided to try something a little bit different. I decided it was time to experiment with <em>curried functions</em>, <em>map</em>, <em>filter</em>, <em>sort</em>, and <em>reduce</em> in Objective-C.</p>
<p>Swift collections implement <em>map</em>, <em>sort</em>, <em>filter</em>, and <em>reduce</em>, so the first step on my experiment was to reimplement these in a <code>NSArray</code> category, trying to match the method signature that Swift implements.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Map</strong>: given a <em>transform operation</em>, it returns a new <code>NSArray</code> where all its elements are transformed according to the operation. The <em>transform operation</em> takes an object and returns another object (that might be of a different type of the original object).</li>
<li><strong>Filter</strong>: given a <em>condition operation</em>, it returns a new <code>NSArray</code> where all its elements satisfy the condition. The <em>condition operation</em> takes an object and returns a boolean.</li>
<li><strong>Sort</strong>: given a <em>sort condition</em>, it returns a new <code>NSArray</code> where all its elements are sorted according to the condition. The <em>sort condition</em> takes two objects and returns a boolean.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce</strong>: given a <em>combine operation</em>, it returns a recombined object by recursively processing its constituent parts. The <em>combine operation</em> takes the initial state and an object and returns a recombined object which is of the same type of the initial state.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>NSArray</code> category ended up with the following interface:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Simple.</p>
<p>For <em>filtering</em>, the method requires a movie and returns <em>true</em> when the movie matches the condition and <em>false</em> otherwise. Below, a simple way to create an immutable array containing the Sean Connery movies.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-objc" data-lang="objc"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold">BOOL</span>(^isConnery)(Movie *) = ^<span style="color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold">BOOL</span>(Movie *a) {

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>};
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>NSArray&lt;Movie *&gt; *conneryMovies = [movies filter:isConnery];
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>But here is the tricky part. To filter movies played by other actors, more blocks like the one above would be required. The <em>functional</em> way to address this is using curried functions — popular technique in Swift (and in other Functional Programming languages).</p>
<p>Since <em>filter</em> expects a block that takes a movie and returns a boolean, another function is required, where its output is a function matching this signature.</p>
<p>The new function takes a string (actor’s name) and returns a function that takes a movie and returns a boolean.</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>NSArray&lt;Movie *&gt; *actorMovies = [movies filter:isActor(<span style="color:#ed9d13">@&#34;Daniel Craig&#34;</span>)];
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Without any changes to the <em>filter</em> method signature or implementation, it’s possible to filter the array of movies to get a list of movies played by any actor on the big screen.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s possible to combine all these functions to achieve the desired result. Let’s say I want the movies were Pierce Brosnan played James Bond, <em>sorted</em> by ratings and <em>reduced</em> to a list.</p>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>Brosnan movies sorted by ratings:

* Die Another Day (Tomatometer: 57)
* Tomorrow Never Dies (Tomatometer: 57)
* The World Is Not Enough (Tomatometer: 51)
</code></pre><p>But putting all the fun and excitement aside, would I use these methods on an Objective-C project? Probably not — <code>NSArray</code> already implements methods for sorting and filtering arrays using <code>NSPredicate</code>.</p>
<p>My point here was to experiment and practice <em>map</em>, <em>filter</em>, <em>sort</em>, <em>reduce</em>, and <em>curried functions</em>. Programming requires practice. And practicing these techniques and methods (and reimplementing them) in Objective-C improved the way I use them in Swift.</p>

<p>But, shortly, what is currying? It’s a technique that transforms a function that takes several arguments into a sequence of functions, each with a single argument. The result is a chain of functions returning functions. It’s beautiful, it’s mathematics!</p>
