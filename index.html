			 <p>👨‍💻 Nintendo has <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/21/nintendo-adds-passkey-support/">introduced Passkey support</a>. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s currently not possible to rename the keys, which can be challenging for people who have multiple keys. And, it does not function with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YubiKey">Yubikeys</a>. Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s nice move!</p>

			 <p>It was a shorter week for me as I took Friday off to unwind. Well, I must admit, I did spend some time reading and catching up on articles from the &lsquo;read-it-later&rsquo; service I use, and watching the news from my Country.</p>
<p>This week, <strong>I released version 2.0.0 of my Obsidian plug-in</strong>, <a href="https://otavio.cc/micropublish/">Micro.publish</a>, which now allows users to edit <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> posts that were previously published using the plug-in. Implementing this feature was a lot of fun, and I&rsquo;m thrilled with the results. In fact, both of the lengthy posts I published this week were composed and edited (a couple of times) using the plug-in:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/09/13/micropublish.html">Micro.publish 2.0.0</a></li>
<li><a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/09/14/the-day-i.html">The day I emailed Tim Cook</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As they say, “eat your own dog food.”</p>
<p>I also wrapped up the second season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_(TV_series)">The Bear</a>, which is a fantastic TV show. I&rsquo;m crossing my fingers for another season!</p>
<p>Additionally, I finished watching the second season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Afterparty_(TV_series)">The Afterparty</a> without any idea who the killer would turn out to be.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m all caught up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Murders_in_the_Building">Only Murders in the Building</a>, yet another killer — pun intended — TV show.</p>
<p>On the digital front, I decided to delete my <a href="https://pixelfed.social/">Pixelfed</a>, <a href="https://lemmy.world/">Lemmy</a>, and <a href="https://kbin.social/">Kbin</a> accounts. Since I never really used these accounts, it made sense to bid them farewell.</p>
<p>Lastly, there&rsquo;s some exciting news on the personal front: <strong>tinyScientist sprouted another tooth</strong>! The milestones just keep coming!</p>

			 <p>Over a decade ago, there was a recall for the white MacBook, specifically for replacing the notebook&rsquo;s bottom part. This part, made of rubber, had a tendency to peel off due to the heat generated by the computer.</p>
<p>In the United States, MacBook users had the option to either take their computer to an Apple Store for a replacement of the bottom part or request to have the replacement part delivered to their homes for self-installation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this was not the case in Brazil. At that time, Apple did not have physical stores in Brazil, only the online Apple Store, and technical support was exclusively available through authorized stores.</p>
<p>I visited a couple of authorized stores in my city, where I was informed that I would need to leave the computer with them for a month. This duration was required for them to request, receive, and replace the part.</p>
<p>I decided to contact the Apple Store directly, explaining that leaving the notebook at an authorized store for an entire month was not feasible. However, I was informed that this was the standard procedure for Apple&rsquo;s relationship with authorized stores in Brazil—they were required to retain the device during the repair process.</p>
<p>The laptop wasn&rsquo;t mine; it belonged to my wife, who was working on her Ph.D. thesis. Under no circumstances could we afford to leave her computer at a store for an extended period.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I sent an email to Tim Cook, explaining the situation. I mentioned that in the US, a recall was in place, and they were sending replacement parts for self-installation, whereas in Brazil, we were required to leave the essential computer my wife needed to complete her studies in an authorized store for an entire month. I signed the email with my name and phone number.</p>
<p>I was mentally prepared to be ignored.</p>
<p>A few hours later, I received a call from Apple, from a representative who worked for the Vice President of Retail for Latin America. It was a brief call; they didn&rsquo;t inquire much and stated, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling to resolve your problem.&rdquo; They didn&rsquo;t say they would attempt to resolve it; they asserted they would indeed resolve it. I surmised that individuals at this level do not waste time; they take actions. All they asked of me was to pick the nearest authorized store to my home, where the replacement part would be delivered. They also assured me that once the part arrived, the store would call me to arrange for its replacement.</p>
<p>A week later, I received a call from the authorized store and proceeded to their location. The replacement part was installed right at the store&rsquo;s counter. An employee at the store asked, &ldquo;How did you manage to persuade Apple to send us the replacement part?&rdquo; To which I replied, &ldquo;I emailed Tim Cook.&rdquo; They probably found it hard to believe, but it worked. Ultimately, that&rsquo;s all that matters.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/09/13/micropublish.html">Micro.publish 2.0.0</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/09/13/micropublish.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-09-13 13:28:46 &#43;0200">Sep 13, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Starting from version 2.0.0, it is possible to update a post that was previously composed and published via <a href="https://otavio.cc/micropublish/">Micro.publish</a>.</p>
<p>Before diving into the specifics of this feature, it&rsquo;s important to mention a few design decisions that were made in order to implement this functionality.</p>
<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> conforms to the <a href="https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/">Micropub protocol</a>, which outlines the procedures for publishing notes, uploading images, assigning categories, saving bookmarks, and updating posts.</p>
<p>When updating a post, the protocol requires the inclusion of the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original post&rsquo;s <code>URL</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>blogID</code>, especially relevant for users managing multiple blogs.</li>
<li>The updated <code>content</code> and/or <code>title</code> of the post.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obsidian offers plugins developers the option to locally store data within the vault. However, this capability is limited and necessitates custom implementation. For this reason, it was decided to store the published post&rsquo;s <code>URL</code> within the Obsidian note itself using YAML frontmatter (and the new Properties feature). This approach ensures that the information remains readily accessible and easily modifiable if necessary.</p>
<h2 id="version-200">Version 2.0.0</h2>
<p>For posts <strong>published with version 2.0.0 or newer</strong>, the post&rsquo;s <code>URL</code> will be added to the Markdown file in the YAML frontmatter/Property.</p>
<p>For those in <em>Edit mode</em>, it appears as a Property as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/properties.png" alt="Properties"></p>
<p>And for those utilizing the <em>Source mode</em>, as YAML:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/frontmatter.png" alt="Frontmatter"></p>
<p>Once the note or title has been edited (either through the filename or <a href="https://otavio.cc/micropublish/#properties">YAML/Property</a>), updating is as simple as using the <a href="https://otavio.cc/micropublish/#publishing"><em>Post to Micro.blog</em> command from the Command Palette</a>. A simplified version of the Review view will appear, displaying the post&rsquo;s title. For users with multiple blogs, it will prompt them to confirm which blog the post belongs to.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/reviewedit.png" alt="Review/Edit"></p>
<h2 id="editing-posts-from-previous-versions">Editing posts from previous versions</h2>
<p>It is also possible to update posts that were <strong>published using Micro.publish versions prior to 2.0.0</strong>. To do so, you must include a Property (or field in the YAML frontmatter) named <code>url</code> containing the URL of the published post, as illustrated below.</p>
<p>To include a new Property, simply follow these steps in the Command Palette:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/add-property.png" alt="Add Property"></p>
<p>And add the <code>url</code> with the published post URL:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/14222/2023/properties.png" alt="Properties"></p>
<p>Those who prefer the YAML file can add the the <code>url</code> using the format:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#fff;background-color:#1f1f24;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="display:flex;"><span>---
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>url: https://example.com/path/to/post.html
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>---
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After editing the note or title (either through the filename or YAML/Property), updating is as straightforward as utilizing the <em>Post to Micro.blog</em> command from the Command Palette. Similar to the process for version 2.0.0, a simplified version of the Review view will be presented, featuring the post&rsquo;s title. For users with multiple blogs, it will inquire about the blog to which the post should be associated.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been working on version 2.0.0 of <a href="https://otavio.cc/micropublish/">Micro.publish</a>, which will introduce the <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/09/09/posting-and-updating.html">ability to edit Micro.blog posts</a> originally composed and published through <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. I&rsquo;ve managed to allocate a small fraction of my daily time to this project, and progress has been quite promising. I already have it functioning, and I&rsquo;m currently in the testing phase before releasing it.</p>
<p>I made a change in my online presence, deleting my old Matrix account, which had been lying dormant, and creating a new one using the <a href="http://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> server.</p>
<p>Also part of the recent changes, I decided to remove Bluesky from my phone and disabled cross-posting to <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://nostr.com/">Nostr</a>. I&rsquo;ll continue cross-posting to <a href="https://social.lol/@otaviocc">Mastodon</a> but have enabled the &ldquo;Automated Post Deletion&rdquo; feature for posts older than one week. In the case of Bluesky, I went ahead and deleted all of my posts there.</p>
<p>I went on a trip to Lithuania for our <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/09/08/team-offsite.html">Apple Team off-site</a>. We spent our time in cabins in the countryside, and the remarkable thing about our getaway was that work was the only topic we deliberately avoided. During my stay, I made the most of the picturesque setting to capture numerous photos.</p>
<p>When returning home, I was warmly welcomed by <em>scientist</em> and <em>tinyScientist</em> at the airport. <em>tinyScientist</em> seemed frozen at first when he saw me, but quickly jumped into my arms once we reunited.</p>
<p>Last but not least, exciting news, <em>tinyScientist</em> just sprouted his very first tooth!</p>

			 <p>Every now and then, we organize an off-site event for our entire Apple Team. Since our team members are based in different countries, coming together is a fantastic opportunity to foster stronger connections.</p>
<p>On this occasion, we rented cabins in the Lithuanian countryside. We spent our time there engaging in various activities such as playing cards, tabletop games, soccer, basketball, as well as enjoying some drinks and delicious food.</p>
<p>Our group consisted of over 30 people, including Product Owners, Engineering Managers, Team Leads, Software Engineers, and Quality Assurance.</p>
<p>Obviously, I dedicated some time to taking photos. Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t have my Fujifilm X100V with me, so I had to use my iPhone. The pictures are unedited and captured using the <a href="https://ritchiecam.com/">RitchieCam</a> app, following the SOOC (Straight Out of Camera) approach.</p>

			 <p>Earlier this week, I published <a href="https://otavio.cc/micropublish/">Micro.publish 1.7.0</a>, which introduces support for YAML frontmatter/Properties for titles and tags. I am so happy with all the feedback I received and all the coffees I was gifted!</p>
<p>I renewed my subscription to <a href="https://obsidian.md/sync">Obsidian Sync</a>. I had canceled it a while ago, but I realized that Obsidian is the best solution for note-taking and syncing notes between different devices. I need my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a> on both my personal and work devices.</p>
<p>We took <em>tinyScientist</em> to two doctor&rsquo;s appointments this week. The first was a routine checkup with the pediatrician, and the second was a follow-up appointment with a specialist (related to the surgery he had earlier this year). <em>tinyScientist</em> is doing well!</p>
<p>I am very particular about color schemes and wallpapers, but this week I found the perfect wallpaper for <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/09/01/i-have-found.html">my computer</a> and <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/08/31/found-the-perfect.html">phone</a>.</p>
<p>I also updated several entries in my Digital Garden:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://otavio.cc/micropublish/">Micro.publish</a></li>
<li><a href="https://otavio.cc/micropublish-changelog/">Micro.publish Changelog</a></li>

<li><a href="https://otavio.cc/pair-programming-tdd-rotation/">Pair Programming, TDD, and Rotation?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>and the <a href="https://github.com/otaviocc/obsidian-microblog">Micro.publish page on GitHub</a>, which is the content displayed in Obsidian&rsquo;s <em>Community Plugins</em> section.</p>
<p>I received some very sad news that my favorite barista in the city passed away suddenly. Not only was her coffee amazing, but she was also a wonderful person. She always treated <em>tinyScientist</em> very well, and he loved her.</p>
<p>Last but not least, it was my work anniversary. I have been with Nord Security (<a href="https://nordvpn.com/">NordVPN</a>) for two years now. Every year, we receive a gift from the company, and this year I got a baseball cap with the NordVPN logo on it.</p>

			 <p>I had to brave the German bureaucracy and visit the post office to mail a letter. It&rsquo;s not the most exciting way to spend a Saturday morning, but it&rsquo;s necessary sometimes.</p>
<p>I renewed my local library card for just €10/year. It&rsquo;s an amazing deal, considering that it gives me access to physical and digital books, audiobooks, magazines, newspapers, and more. I&rsquo;m especially excited about the <a href="https://www.manton.org/2023/06/21/good-morning-libby.html">new feature in Micro.blog</a> that lets me connect my Libby account and import my bookshelves. Perfect timing!</p>
<p>Yesterday I published a <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/08/12/reading-services.html">post about reading services</a>, and I decided to go back to using Readwise&rsquo;s Reader as both a read-later service and RSS feed client. I canceled my Feedbin subscription because Readwise&rsquo;s Reader saves me time by letting me access all of my content in one place.</p>
<p>I consolidated my photos from my photoblog to my blog and deleted the photoblog. I wrote a little bit about it <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/08/02/at-the-same.html">here</a> and <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/08/02/i-created-a.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/08/08/apple-music-launches.html">Apple&rsquo;s new Discovery Station</a> has been a pleasant surprise. I&rsquo;ve found a few new songs that I really like, and even the songs that I haven&rsquo;t been crazy about have been interesting enough to keep me listening.</p>
<p>I deleted my Wolt account again, but this time I&rsquo;m determined to stick to my decision. Wolt makes it too easy to be lazy and order food, and the costs can add up quickly.</p>
<p>I love the <a href="https://glass.photo">Glass.photo</a> community, so I was excited to see that they introduced a new subscription tier called Patron. Patron offers a variety of benefits, including app customizations, access to new features, and three 1-year accounts to share with family and friends. I subscribed as soon as I saw <a href="https://glass.photo/highlights/introducing-patron">their post</a>. My home screen loves the new icons.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just started watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_All_Mankind_(TV_series)">For All Mankind</a>, and I&rsquo;m really enjoying it so far. I&rsquo;ve only watched half season, but it&rsquo;s already clear that this is a well-made show. I&rsquo;m excited to see where the story goes next.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using Passkeys on GitHub, Google, omg.lol, and rad.dad. It&rsquo;s a shame that Passage, 1Password&rsquo;s passkey solution for websites, doesn&rsquo;t support <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">YubiKeys</a> yet.</p>
<p>Discord is <a href="https://discord.com/blog/usernames">rolling out changes to usernames</a>, removing the four-digit discriminator. As a non-Nitro subscriber, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting to be able to claim my username so soon. Anyway, I’m <code>otaviocc</code> there.</p>

			 <p>TL;DR: I&rsquo;m using Readwise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>👨‍💻 I’m a happy Feedbin user, but recently I feel I’m constantly switching between Reeder, app I use to access Feedbin, and Readwise’s Reader. I’m gonna give Reader’s feed feature a chance for a week and see how it goes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weeks ago, I <a href="https://otavio.cc/about/">decided</a> to try <a href="https://readwise.io/">Readwise</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Reader</a> as an RSS feed reader for a week. I felt I was spending too much time going back and forth between <a href="https://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a> and Reader, sometimes having to copy and paste URLs manually.</p>
<p>After a few weeks of using Readwise&rsquo;s RSS feature, I decided it wasn&rsquo;t for me. Reader tries to be smart by fetching the content of the URL in the feed, instead of showing the content from the feed itself.</p>
<p>It tries to be smart because several websites return partial content in their RSS, but it often fails to fetch the content. This is especially true for microblogs.</p>
<p>So I decided to go back to Feedbin (using the app <a href="https://www.reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>) and use <a href="https://getpocket.com/saves">Pocket</a> as a read-later service (using Reeder and their official app). However, I quickly noticed that Pocket often fails to parse pages, and their new app doesn&rsquo;t have highlighting. So that was a no-go.</p>
<p>Next, I tried <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/u">Instapaper</a>. Instapaper is the first read-later app I ever used, decades ago, and it hasn&rsquo;t changed much since then. That&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing, since the app does exactly what I expect it to do. However, it does fail to parse some content, such as images and code blocks from pages and blogs I read often.</p>
<p>That brings me to <a href="https://hq.getmatter.com/">Matter</a>, which I&rsquo;m a patron of. Matter offers the best overall experience of all the apps I&rsquo;ve tried. The website is beautifully made, the apps are native, and the colors and typography are lovely. However, it also often fails to parse content, redirecting me to the original website instead.</p>
<p>Matter has the best customer service of all the apps I&rsquo;ve tried. As soon as you report something to them, they quickly fix the content.</p>
<p>As Readwise&rsquo;s Reader, Matter also supports RSS feeds. And like Readwise, it tries to be smart and parse the content from the URL instead of using the content already in the feed.
I&rsquo;ve noticed that Matter&rsquo;s RSS feature often fails to retrieve the content of the page, redirecting me to the original URL, as it does when saving an article to the Queue. Sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t show an item from the RSS at all. It simply ignores the post without any explanation.</p>
<p>Long story short, after several tests and setups, <strong>I&rsquo;m back to Readwise&rsquo;s Reader</strong>. It&rsquo;s the most stable of all the setups I&rsquo;ve tried, even though it isn&rsquo;t pretty and sometimes fails trying to be smart. It also isn&rsquo;t native, which causes some weird glitches. But it works most of the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still a patron of Matter and will keep it installed on my devices, using it every now and then to follow its progress. But for now, Readwise&rsquo;s Reader is the one on my main screen.</p>

<p>The feature I missed the most when I switched from Spotify to Apple Music was the Discover Weekly. At some point Spotify&rsquo;s recommendations were so good that I would spend the week just listening to the Discover Weekly and nothing else.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a real bummer. It&rsquo;s true TouchID and FaceID are widespread, but I like to use two keys as backup (and for work related stuff).</p>

<p>The last notes I wrote are from <a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/05/07/no-highlights-this.html">Week 2023-18</a>, and so many things happened since that post that I won&rsquo;t even try to remember all the details. Instead, I&rsquo;ll focus in some of the highlights.</p>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p><em>tinyScientist</em> had his first surgery and had to stay in hospital for almost a week for recovery.</p>
<p>The surgery took seven hours, from the first incision to the last stitch, according to the doctors, followed by another two hours in post-anesthesia recovery. An eternity if you ask us. But we were waiting and preparing for this day since the fourth month of pregnancy, having monthly appointments with doctors and midwife to talk about the surgery, steps for before and after, etc…</p>
<p>The surgery was a success, and <em>tinyScientist</em> is recovering well. He was exhausted and bored during the week he had to stay hospitalized, but that&rsquo;s all in the past now.</p>
<p>To celebrate I asked <a href="https://ko-fi.com/andycarolan/commissions">Andy Carolan</a> to create profile pictures for the family. They&rsquo;re all awesome, but <em>tinyScientist</em>&rsquo;s is a piece of art.</p>
<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2>
<p>Watched two movies recently, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons:_Honor_Among_Thieves">Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Super_Mario_Bros._Movie">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>.</p>
<p>I was skeptical about <strong>D&amp;D</strong>, but loved the movie. The balance between humor, action, and luck is perfect. Great easter eggs as well!</p>
<p><strong>Super Mario</strong> is fun, good entertainment. I don’t understand why people were complaining about it. It’s a kids movie, what were they expecting?</p>
<h2 id="playing">Playing</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda%3A_Tears_of_the_Kingdom">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> was released the day my son had his surgery. On the day before - thanks Amazon! - I got the standard version and on the release day I got the Collector’s Edition.</p>
<p>The days after the surgery were extremely busy and I didn’t find time to play it, but this week I finally did. What can I say? It’s even better than the best game ever made (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>).</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I love a good dystopian story, and when I saw the trailer for <a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/originals/silo/">Silo</a> I decided to buy the <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780358447825">The Silo Saga</a> to read.</p>
<h2 id="hacking">Hacking</h2>
<h3 id="micropublish">Micro.publish</h3>
<p>A user reported that <a href="https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=micro.publish">Micro.publish</a> allowed to run the publish command with an empty post, resulting in error since Micro.blog doesn’t support empty posts (obviously).</p>
<p>So I released a minor update - 1.6.0 - fixing it. After the change, users will be prompted with a message saying they have to write something before publishing into Micro.blog.</p>
<p>I’ve also updated the <em>donate</em> button inside the Plug-in to use <a href="https://ko-fi.com/otaviocc">Ko-fi</a> instead of <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/otaviocc">BuyMeACoffee</a>. I like that platform better.</p>

<p>I’m back working on my <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> client for macOS. Didn’t put much time on it, but was using and testing the app to make sure it looks good for releasing it.</p>
<h3 id="appnet-import">App.net import</h3>
<p><a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/06/02/appnet-archive-migrated.html">Quickly wrote a script</a> to download all my App.net posts and published them as a <a href="https://otavio.cc/adn/">page in my blog</a>. I might, someday, import those posts as regular posts in this blog, but for now I&rsquo;ll keep them in a separate page.</p>

<p>I’m on <strong>Bluesky</strong>, this new social network created by another billionaire. I don’t have plans to create content there, my focus is, and always will be, <strong>Micro.blog</strong>. The plan is to <em>cross-post</em> what I write on my blog there, as I already do with <strong>Mastodon</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bluesky</strong>: <code>@otavio.cc</code></li>
<li><strong>Mastodon</strong>: <code>@otaviocc@social.lol</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I canceled <strong>Obsidian Sync</strong> and <strong>Obsidian Publish</strong>. The service is really good, but I’m not it’s worth the price for my needs.  <code>git</code> works just fine for me.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>Monday is the day with most of my meetings, retrospective, pre-planning, planning, syncs with other teams, etc… But this time I attended all from home. I’m avoiding working from the office until <em>tinyScientist</em>’s surgery.</p>
<p>Tuesday I took a day off to talk to doctors about <em>tinyScientist</em>’ surgery. And the rest of the week was just business as usual.</p>
<h2 id="hacking">Hacking</h2>
<p>I wasn’t planning on starting another feature in my <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> client before releasing it to the public, but recently I started using <strong>Pastebin</strong> more and more and thought it would be a good idea to implement it in my client.</p>
<p>On Monday I worked on the <code>PastebinNetworkService</code>, responsible for the network requests for the feature.</p>
<p>Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday I didn’t have time to work on the project, but on Friday I started the <code>PastebinPersistencekService</code>, responsible for persisting the snippets locally on Core Data.</p>
<h2 id="gaming">Gaming</h2>
<p>The reason I didn’t have much time to work on my app has a name: <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/cult-of-the-lamb-switch/">Cult of the Lamb</a>.</p>
<h2 id="photography">Photography</h2>
<p><a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/04/18/week.html">Two weeks ago I traveled to Turkey</a> for the company Workation and didn’t take my camera with me. I knew I would miss the opportunity to take amazing photos, but I wanted to pack light, using a single backpack. So, I challenged myself to take RAW photos using my iPhone instead.</p>
<p>Everything I know about RAW is theoretical. I don’t shoot RAW and don’t know how to edit or “develop” photos of this format.</p>
<p>I have <a href="https://www.darkroom.co/">Darkroom</a> instead on my devices, because I bought the life-time license a long time ago, and decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>Darkroom is magical. All the controls and features are so intuitive I was impressed by the results. I even created a Preset for me, so that I can apply the same look and feel to other “similar” photos.</p>
<p>Will I use RAW on my camera? No. My Fujifilm camera is for SOOC photos only, but I might start shooting RAW more often on the phone.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not using any plugin to maintain a Digital Garden on Micro.blog. It would require a lot of transformation (file paths, dealing with file names, etc&hellip;) and I don&rsquo;t have much time now to put into a new plugin. For now it&rsquo;s all manually maintained.</p>

<p><a href="https://otavio.cc/2023/04/18/week.html">Last week</a> I arrived from the Workation on Sunday, and stayed at home most of the week. The first time I left home this week was on Thursday.</p>
<p>Just to be on the safe side, I took several COVID-19 tests. <em>tinyScientist</em>’s surgery is less than a month from now, and we want to protect him from any sort of cold or flu.</p>
<p>We were planning to take him to the zoo on Saturday to see the lions, but it was one of those rare sunny days, so the zoo was probably packed with kids, better to avoid it a while longer.</p>
<p>Decided to walk in the city instead, found a park that’s open enough, and took tons of pictures. Also, coffee…</p>

<p>Another short week in Germany 🇩🇪. On Monday, we had a holiday, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Monday">Easter Monday</a>, and, as the day was beautiful, we took <em>tinyScientist</em> to a park. It was his first time on a swing (for babies), and he loved it!</p>
<p>I like visiting different places, but I hate traveling. A simple 3-hour flight means a whole day of preparations, trains, airport, security checks, etc… but we don’t have teleportation yet, so…</p>
<h2 id="working-vacationing-hacking-partying">Working? Vacationing? Hacking? Partying?</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This week we had our Workation and almost all of <a href="https://nordsecurity.com/">Nord Security</a> traveled to a resort in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey">Turkey</a> 🇹🇷; more than 1000 people flew from different parts of the World to our 2023 gathering. That’s not a typo, 10^3+ people traveled to our event…</p>
<h3 id="wednesday">Wednesday</h3>
<p>For me, it all started with a train ride to the airport. Although the airport is far from the city center, public transit works and the express train runs from the Hauptbahnhof to the airport terminal in about 20–25 minutes.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="thursday">Thursday</h3>
<p>We arrived at the resort around 2am after a long flight and bus ride from the Antalya airport to the hotel. The main restaurant and bar are open until 6am, so after checking in, we headed there for dinner.</p>
<p>I missed the city tour in the morning, I was exhausted and barely remember turning off the alarm. I woke up around 10am for a late breakfast, followed by a visit to the Sea. And then back for lunch.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There’s an hour time difference between Antalya and Germany, so after lunch I FaceTimed home to watch <em>tinyScientist</em> having his lunch.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I worked on my <a href="https://omg.lol/">omg.lol</a> for macOS with the most amazing view, and spent the rest of the day chatting with folks from work. Implemented the <code>WebpageNetworkService</code> for the Webpage feature, responsible for all the network calls.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After dinner, I went to my room to FaceTime scientist and <em>tinyScientist</em> again.</p>
<h3 id="friday">Friday</h3>
<p>On Thursday, I went to bed around 9 or 10 pm, planning to wake up earlier on Friday to see the sunrise. I got up around 5:30 am, packed my things and walked to the private beach. Since almost everyone was partying on the night before, I was the only one on the beach in the morning.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Once I was done taking pictures, I sat in a chair, listening to the Mediterranean Sea (and some birds). Priceless. I can’t remember when was the last time I did something like this. Good thing my AirPods Pro had no juice.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another good reason to wake up early: breakfast before everyone else. I didn’t make healthier choices and ate scrambled eggs, egg with vegetables and boiled potatoes.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I spent the rest of the morning socializing with teammates until lunch, which I skipped. The good thing is that all restaurants in the hotel are open 24/7, so having a late lunch is not a problem.</p>
<p>I found time to do some more work on my <a href="https://omg.lol/">omg.lol</a> client. Implemented the <code>WebpagePersistenceService</code> and the <code>WebpageRepository</code>. The first responsible for storing the webpage (and history of changes) on Core Data, and the latter the abstraction on top of the network and persistence services. The glue.</p>
<p>Found a Starbucks inside the resort, next to one of the pools. Since this is an all-inclusive resort, Starbucks is also included. Perfect for cold drinks next to the beach or a pool.</p>
<p>At 4pm, we had our Q1 OKRs meeting with the entire company, followed by dinner and the OKR party. The OKR meeting was the only work part of the workation.</p>
<p>But before the party, I finished the Webpage Feature implementation and can now update <a href="https://otavio.lol/">otavio.lol</a> using it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="saturday">Saturday</h3>
<p>I intended to take more pictures of the sun rising, but I overslept and woke up at 6:30. At that time, the sun was already out there, so I went straight to breakfast. Omelet, bread, and cheese.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And then headed out to my favorite spot in the whole resort.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Implemented the SwiftUI previews for the Webpage UI and then joined some folks from my team by one of the pools, drinking an Iced Coffee Americano from the hotel’s Starbucks.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I felt guilt for my food choices and decided to eat better during lunch.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After lunch, I must have coffee, so I did. After grabbing another Starbucks, I took the opportunity to walk the resort a bit and found this cat – one of many cats that live in the hotel – staring at me.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I spent the rest of the day with my team, chatting and having dinner and some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">baklavas</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When the party started, I went to my room to talk to scientist and <em>tinyScientist</em>, pack my bag, and sleep.</p>
<h3 id="sunday">Sunday</h3>
<p>Homecoming day. I woke up early again, and had a nice walk on the beach, followed by a long, unhealthy breakfast. Our bus was scheduled to leave for the airport at lunchtime, so I might have eaten more than needed to make up for the lunch I was about to miss.</p>
<p>Spent the morning with the folks from the team and left the resort to visit some shops and buy souvenirs and Turkish tea to take back home. My bag was already packed from the day before, but I had to take everything out and repack it to make room for the tea set I bought.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I traveled with a single backpack (a big one, the limit for taking on the cabin), but after putting the tea set in it, it weighed about 10 kg. The limit is 8 kg, and I was afraid someone would weight it at the airport, but no one did, so it was fine.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I was so exhausted I didn’t feel the trip home. It was almost like teleportation finally existed. The workation was spectacular, something I’ve never done before, but it’s good to be back home. I missed scientist and <em>tinyScientist</em>, and seeing them again was a relief. The day ended with us giving <em>tinyScientist</em> a bath.</p>

<p><em>tinyScientist</em> got a new bed. They grow so fast!</p>
<p>After using so many <strong>Read Later</strong> services in the last decade, I believe I can finally stop looking for the right one for me. <a href="https://read.readwise.io/later">Readwise&rsquo;s Read</a> works the way I need a Read Later app to work. Both their apps, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/readwise/id1476885528">Readwise</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/readwise-reader/id1567599761">Read</a>, have performance and UX issues, but they work, deliver what they promise, and are always improving. I was skeptical with all those YouTube videos praising the service, but I decided to give it a try and am impressed.</p>
<p>Last week I migrated all my personal notes from <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> to <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a>, but maybe I was too eager to try Bear&rsquo;s update that I rushed things. Thinking again, Obsidian (and some other apps) offer something Bear doesn&rsquo;t: access to the notes without having to use the their app. Obsidian uses simple <a href="https://commonmark.org/">Markdown</a> files in the file system, while Bear stores all notes and assets in a <em>sqlite</em> database, hidden away from the user.</p>
<p>Portability is an important thing nowadays, especially with so many apps hiding their features behind subscriptions. With simple Markdown files I can edit my notes with anything, including my beloved <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>Another short week at work, 7th of April was the first day of Easter (Good Friday). But I went to the office twice, on Monday and Wednesday, for 1-on-1s with the folks from my team, to support them with their Development Plans.</p>
<h2 id="hacking">Hacking</h2>
<p>I had plans to work on the Webpage Feature of my native <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> client for macOS, but decided to work a little bit on <a href="https://otavio.cc/micropublish/">Micro.publish</a>, my Obsidian plugin to post to Micro.blog.</p>
<p>Readwise&rsquo;s plugin for Obsidian automatically fetches highlights and notes when Obsidian launches, so I decided to do the same for Micro.blog categories. Now, when the user opens Obsidian, it fetches the categories one has on their blogs.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The command to force fetch categories is still present and can be used at any time to retrieve categories (e.g., in case new categories were added directly to Micro.blog while Obsidian was open).</p>
<p>Another feature I&rsquo;ve added is the ability to schedule a post for a future date. I usually don&rsquo;t scheduled my posts, but it&rsquo;s a nice feature to have.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve also updated <a href="https://otavio.cc/">my blog</a>&rsquo;s colors to match the Obsidian dark theme I use, and used Xcode dark colors for the <a href="https://otavio.cc/mocks/">code snippets</a>. Feels much more natural to me now.</p>
<h2 id="photography">Photography</h2>
<p>During the week I published another page to my <a href="https://otavio.cc/kleingarten/">Digital Garden</a>, <a href="https://otavio.cc/obscura/">Obscura</a>, where I detail the setup I have to take Monochrome photos using the app.</p>
<p>Later during the week I updated the page to include the missing piece in my setup, which was causing Glass not to show the EXIF of my photos.</p>
<p>After talking to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@BenRiceM">Ben</a>, Software Engineer behind Obscura, we found what was missing, and now my setup is exactly the way I wanted it to be: Monochrome photos by default, saving JPEG SOOC, and with EXIF preserved, ready to share online (or not).</p>

<p><em>tinyScientist</em> is officially six months old. I was browsing some of his early pictures and it’s crazy how much things have changed in such a short time. This week he tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsnip">Parsnip</a> and Potato. He loved the first, but didn’t enjoy the latter that much. Pumpkin is still this favorite.</p>
<p>Browsing <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/en-de">Disney+</a> I found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devs">Devs</a>, a Hulu TV Show I had no idea existed. It&rsquo;s an 8-episode miniseries about <em>free will</em> and <em>determinism</em> where <a href="https://nickofferman.co/">Nick Offerman</a> runs a tech company with quantum technology to&hellip; It doesn&rsquo;t matter, it&rsquo;s Nick Offerman. Interesting show, watched the entire thing.</p>
<p>Last week Bear <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bearapp/comments/11xlgxs/the_bear_2_beta_is_here/">released Bear 2 Beta on TestFlight</a> and, as a big Bear fan, I downloaded it to try. The editor was rebuilt from scratch, adding features users were asking for a long time. One of my favorite features is <em>backlinks</em>, something all <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> users know well. Currently Bear supports <code>[[WikiLinks]]</code>, allowing one to link another note (as Obsidian does), but the new version implements <em>backlinks</em>, showing which pages link the one selected. It also shows pages that mention the page but don&rsquo;t link them (<em>Unlinked Mention</em>). This is big! I exported all my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a> notes from Obsidian and imported on Bear and will use it for now on. And it&rsquo;s a native application, and I’m a sucker for good native applications.</p>
<p>I’m using <a href="https://arc.net/">Arc</a> from <a href="https://thebrowser.company/">The Browser Company</a> as default browser in my work computer for a few months, and I’m loving it. The way the tabs are managed, the different spaces, and profiles, the pinned tabs, etc… I’m the kind of person who can’t handle multiple tabs open at the same time, quickly getting lost in a see of tiny <em>favicons</em>. Arc changed that completely, I can easily keep several sites open simultaneously and, more importantly, find my way in it.</p>
<p>Thursday <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEE8GhLy6U4">Arc released Arc for iPhone</a>. It’s not a browser but a <em>bookmark</em> manager. It gives access to Spaces, Easel, and Notes one has on their computer. And offers the ability to create new tabs by importing URLs from other apps via the iOS’ share sheet. Still not sure how useful it is; time will tell.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>Most of the time I work from home, but if there&rsquo;s a day I like to go to the office, this day is Monday. It&rsquo;s the day I have most of my meetings (Retrospective, Planning, 1-on-1s), and it&rsquo;s the day the kitchen is restocked. Big day.</p>
<p>On Wednesday we had a public <a href="https://nordvpn.com/meshnet/">Meshnet</a> Meetup, open to the community where the team talked about the feature and technical details and concepts on networking and how the whole architecture was designed and built. My <a href="https://nordvpn.com/download/mac/">macOS team</a> works on Meshnet, and I’m happy to see the company promoting and talking about what we’re building openly. We even released <a href="https://github.com/NordSecurity/libtelio">some</a> of the <a href="https://github.com/NordSecurity/libdrop">libraries</a> as open source software. And, as in most meetups, tons of pizza and beer.</p>
<p>During March I experienced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-day_workweek">4-day workweeks</a>, but this week I had two days off, Thursday and Friday. Finally used all my vacation days from 2022.</p>
<h2 id="hacking">Hacking</h2>
<p>I finished the Now Pages support on my <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> app for macOS. The implementation allows the user to update their Now Pages and keeps a history of previous edits, in case the user wants to roll back a version.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Additionally, I&rsquo;ve added a way to share the Now Page as a Status in the Statuslog.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next week I plan to add the Webpage feature, so that users can edit their pages. Once that’s done, I will decide on how to release the application. I don’t know if Open Source or not, if AppStore or direct download (as <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> and <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a>). But I want to get it out before implementing the blog support, which will be a bit more complex.</p>
<h2 id="photography">Photography</h2>
<p>First year I managed to complete Micro.blog’s <a href="https://challenges.micro.blog/2023/02/28/march-photoblogging-challenge.html">March Photo Challenge</a>. I created a category and <a href="https://otavio.cc/categories/mbmar/">added all my photos there,</a>. These are my favorites:</p>

</ul>
<p>I’m planning to write a blog post (or <a href="https://otavio.cc/kleingarten/">Digital Garden</a> entry) about <a href="https://obscura.camera/">Obscura 3</a>, the setup I have, and why it’s my favorite iPhone camera app.</p>

			 <p>Earlier this week I deleted another internet account: <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>.</p>
<p>We - <a href="https://nordsecurity.com/">Nord Security</a> - hosted the <strong>CocoaHead Berlin</strong> on Wednesday. It was great, full house, and we had too speakers from Nord Security. Bob from <a href="https://nordlocker.com/">NordLocker</a> talked about SwiftUI and Ieva from <a href="https://nordvpn.com/">NordVPN</a> about <a href="https://fastlane.tools/">fastlane</a>, screenshot automation and the iOS strategy to inject mock data for App Store screenshots.</p>
<p>Speaking of work, on Thursday I had a long training on Leadership (and Management) at the company. Earlier this year I got a new title/role, going from <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> to <strong>Engineering Team Lead</strong>, which means I’m half of the time Software Engineer and the other half Engineering Manager. It’s a brand new world to me, so I went back home exhausted. There’s a lot to process.</p>
<p>On Friday I had another day off, still taking 2022 vacation days before the end of March (German regulations, vacation days from a given year have to be spent before end of March of the following year). I took <em>tinyScientist</em> to a coffee shop around 9am, where <em>we</em> had coffee with a friend and talked about iOS and macOS development, leadership and management, and layoffs. <em>tinyScientist</em> got bored with all the talk and decided to take a nap in his <em>kinderwagen</em>.</p>
<p>In the previous weeks I finished two features of my <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> native client: <em>Statuslog</em> and <em>PURLs</em>, and during this week I started working on the <strong>Now Page</strong>. I still don’t know how I’m gonna distribute the app, if via AppStore, or directly for download as NetNewWire and Micro.blog do. Same goes for pricing, I still haven’t decided if it’ll be a paid app or not.</p>
<p>Finally, the most important thing which happened during the week: <em>tinyScientist</em> <strong>had his first <em>solid</em> meal</strong>. We were not expecting him to eat (we thought he would only play with the food), but he loved pumpkin. As result, he had pumpkin four days in a row for lunch.</p>

			 <p>On Tuesday I returned from a 10-day vacation, and on Friday I had another day off. In Germany there’s no carry over from one year to another, and the deadline to spend the vacation days from the previous year is end of March. As I still have vacation days from 2022 that I’m <em>forced</em> to take, I’m taking all the Fridays off until the end of the Month.</p>
<p>During the week we took <em>tinyScientist</em> to the doctor to do some extra tests he’ll for his surgery. We’re excited for him, but anxious as hell. I have faith in Science and in the doctors here. The support he’s getting from them is spectacular.</p>
<p>After months waiting for <em>tinyScientist</em>’s <a href="https://otavio.cc/child-benefits-in-germany/">Kindergeld</a>, it has finally arrived. Bureaucracy in Germany is a big thing, but at the end everything works as expected.</p>
<p>Last weekend I finished the modular architecture for my <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> client for macOS. The first feature I built while working in the architecture was the <em>Statuslog</em>. During the week, with just a few hours here and there I added <em>PURLs</em>. It’s a good indicator the modular architecture is a success. My goal was to achieve full decoupling in a way it should be easy to extend the application and add new features.</p>
<p>I started playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopath_Traveler_II">Octopath Traveler II</a>. The first game was amazing, and I ordered the second game as soon as they started selling it.</p>

It&rsquo;s part of a series of notes on <a href="https://otavio.cc/unit-testing/">unit testing with doubles and fixtures</a> that I&rsquo;m putting together. The examples are in Swift, but the concepts are the same for all languages.</p>

Digital Gardens don&rsquo;t follow the same structure of a blog and are in constant mutation. For now you can find there:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://otavio.cc/unit-testing">Unit Testing With Doubles and Fixtures</a></li>
<li><a href="https://otavio.cc/open-source">Contributions and Projects</a></li>
<li><a href="https://otavio.cc/child-benefits-in-germany">Child Benefits in Germany</a></li>

<p>All the pages have a link to my <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/otaviocc">Buy Me a Coffee page</a>, for those who think the content is useful for them. Coffee helps to keep the Digital Garden growing.</p>

			 <p><strong>Braille Institute</strong> released a font for low vision readers, <a href="https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont">Atkinson Hyperlegible</a>. The font is great and I asked <a href="https://web.getmatter.com/list/queue">Matter</a> to add it to their list of supported fonts. Matter accepted my requested and within a couple of hours they deployed the changes. I’ve update <a href="https://otavio.cc/">my blog</a> to use Atkinson Hyperlegible as well.</p>
<p>I keep going back-and-forth between Reminders and <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>. Every time there&rsquo;s a new macOS version I go back to Reminders to see what changed. But the truth is, Things is an amazing app and I decided to go back to it. The best of all, I can synchronize Things on all the computers I use, no matter if they’re using the same Apple ID or not. Reminders use iCloud, so I’m limited to the Apple ID I’m using. The downside is that I had to pay for Things twice.</p>
<p>Same goes for Safari and Firefox. I’m a big Firefox fan (since it was called Phoenix) and love the <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers">Multi-Account Containers</a> feature, but Safari is so much faster and has better support for physical keys and Apple Pay so I keep going back to it.</p>
<p>I read a review about <a href="https://readkit.app/">ReadKit</a> and decided to give it a try. I deleted Reeder from my devices to force myself to use it. The application is actually nice and I’m enjoying it a lot. I like the way it integrates with Pinboard as well, which is a service I use for about 15 years. It supports Smart Folders, a great feature when subscribing to tons of feeds.</p>
<p>Decided to create a <a href="https://otavio.cc/kleingarten/">mini Digital Garden</a> on Micro.blog. It&rsquo;s not perfect because I have to create all the links between pages manually. But at least all the content is hosted in my blog. I have to check if there&rsquo;s an API to post Pages on Micro.blog directly, and add an option to my <a href="https://otavio.cc/micropublish/">Micro.publish plugin</a> so that people can publish posts and pages from Obsidian. For now, the digital garden has notes about <a href="https://otavio.cc/unit-testing">Unit Testing</a>, <a href="https://otavio.cc/open-source">Open Source</a>, and <a href="https://otavio.cc/child-benefits-in-germany">Child Benefits in Germany</a>.</p>
<p>I released a minor change to <a href="https://otavio.cc/micropublish/">Micro.publish plugin</a>, including a link to my <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/otaviocc">Buy My a Coffee</a> page. I added a link to <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/otaviocc">Buy My a Coffee</a> in all my <a href="https://otavio.cc/kleingarten/">mini Digital Garden</a> pages as well.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re cat sitting for friends and I usually go to their house at night, after <em>tinyScientist</em> goes to bed. I&rsquo;m using my time there to work on my <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> native client for macOS and iOS. My client is fully modularized and each feature is a micro app on its own. Once all the setup is done, the app should scale pretty well, and adding new omg.lol features should be a breeze. I plan to write about <a href="https://otavio.cc/modularization/">Modularization</a> once the setup is finished.</p>
<p>I finally started playing <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/fire-emblem-engage-switch/">Fire Emblem Encore</a>, but already have my eyes on <strong>Metroid Prime Remastered</strong>. I must resist, in two weeks there’s <strong>Octopath Traveler II</strong> and in May, <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</strong>.</p>
<p>LEGO <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-minifigures-series-24-71037">Series 24</a> is complete. We went to a LEGO store and they had hundreds of minifigure bags. Spent a good amount of time there, <em>feeling</em> the bags and found the last two.</p>
<p>And finally, I had to use Twitter to talk to my ISP&rsquo;s support. Their service is too unstable and every now and then I have to contact them to complain (and ask for my money back). Maybe it&rsquo;s time to switch providers so that I don&rsquo;t have to use Twitter anymore.</p>

			 <p>For a couple of reasons I prefer to take photos in JPEG (but that’s a topic for a blog post). That’s what I do with my Fujifilm camera, but not with my iPhone. iOS enhances JPEG photos taken in low light conditions, destroying the mood. The “fix” is to shoot RAW. A real bummer.</p>

			 <p>Earlier this week I took my parents to the airport and had the opportunity to work on my side project on the train on my way back home. For some reason I enjoy coding on trains, buses, and airplanes. Especially when it’s raining outside. A wonderful combination of white noise sounds, I suppose.</p>
<p><em>tinyScientist</em> went to the doctor for his <em>U-Untersuchungen</em> and took some other vaccines. My wife has a Phd in vaccine development working with viruses, so of course <em>tinyScientist</em> won’t miss a single shot.</p>
<p>On Tuesday I returned to work after two weeks off and had my contract updated to match my new title: Engineering Team Lead. Never have I imagined I would take such kind of role, but the setup we have in the company works so well that I decided to accept the challenge. I’m glad I have the time to write code and lead a team.</p>
<p>Internet in Germany has its ups and downs; probably more downs than ups. This week my Internet Provider gave me money back because the service is too unstable in my area, I had to use my phone as personal hotspot in 30% of the meetings I attended.</p>
<p>Earlier this year LEGO released the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-minifigures-series-24-71037">Series 24</a> of its minifigures. We went to a store to <em>feel the packages</em>, as we always do, and found 10 minifigures. Still missing 2.</p>
<p>And finally, I canceled Audible. The local public library is great and offers thousands of audiobooks via <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby">Libby</a> for 10 EUR/year.</p>

			 <p>Obsidian is the <em>source of truth</em> for most of my writings<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and I though it would be interesting to post to <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> directly from it. In the past I explored several applications such as <a href="https://ulysses.app/">Ulysses</a>, <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>, and many others which allow publishing to Micro.blog, but they don&rsquo;t work for me, they don&rsquo;t reflect the way I think and take notes. Obsidian does.</p>
<p>So I searched on Micro.blog and found <a href="https://philbowell.me/2021/12/22/i-wonder-if.html">this post</a> from <a href="https://micro.blog/philbowell">@philbowell</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wonder if there is a way to post to Micro.blog from Obsidian. 🤔</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And nope, there isn&rsquo;t. So I took the challenge.</p>
<p>Obsidian isn&rsquo;t a native application and I can&rsquo;t remember when it was the last time I wrote something which isn&rsquo;t <em>compiled</em> to run on an specific architecture 👨‍💻, so I had to learn <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> and <code>npm</code>, and spent a good amount of time making <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> look pretty (stealing ideas from my friend <a href="https://atila.io/">Atila</a>).</p>
<p>Luckily for me, the TypeScript syntax isn&rsquo;t that different from Swift, so in a matter of hours I had something working. Since the Obsidian Plugin architecture is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a>, I decided to go with OOP using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel">MVVM</a>, without third-party dependencies to avoid taking unnecessary complexity into Obsidian.</p>
<p>The result of all this is <a href="https://github.com/otaviocc/obsidian-microblog">Micro.publish</a>, my Obsidian plugin to publish to Micro.blog. The plugin isn&rsquo;t available to install from Obsidian&rsquo;s <em>Community Plugins</em> yet since they review all the plugins there, but it&rsquo;s possible to install it directly from GitHub by following some manual steps.</p>
<p>Micro.publish has the features I need. It allows</p>
<ul>
<li>setting default tags</li>
<li>setting the default post visibility</li>
<li>setting a default blog (for those with more than one M.b blog)</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And before publishing, it&rsquo;s possible to override these default settings for the post being published.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>More features are planned, and will be coming soon.</p>

			 <p>First version of my <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> plugin for <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is ready 👨‍💻 Some feature are missing - as expected for a first release -, but I plan to add them in the future. E.g.,</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog selection</li>
<li>Set categories/tags</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently it allows users to</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the default post visibility for new posts</li>
<li>Set the post title</li>
<li>Open post, preview, and edit URLs after publishing the post</li>
</ul>
<p>The plugin can be found on <a href="https://github.com/otaviocc/obsidian-microblog">GitHub</a>. The next step is to submit it to Obsidian&rsquo;s <em>Community Plugins</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: The name isn&rsquo;t final since this is not an official Micro.blog product. I have to find a better name for it.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago I decided to get my leather tools in the cellar and make something. Since I have more than one pouch - a small one, and a bigger when I&rsquo;m carrying my Fuji - I decided to make something to put my pocket notebooks - which I also make -, cards, pocket knife, and flashlight. This way it&rsquo;s easier to move all my EDC from one pouch to another.</p>
<p>Leather work is fun, and for me it works for medidation or to listen to podcasts I need to focus on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the final result. Below the pocket knife and flashlight.</p>

<p>And the one for pocket notebook, cards, and small pen.</p>

			 <p>Apple&rsquo;s new computers look amazing, but it&rsquo;s hard to justify buying one. The most <em>basic</em> 14&quot; model costs $1,999 in the US (before taxes), while the same model costs 2.249 € or $2,600+ in Germany. At least I&rsquo;m not in Brazil, where it costs $4,900+ (27x the country&rsquo;s minimum wage).</p>

			 <p>In 2003/4 I had a side-project where I was using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkback">linkback</a> to build a platform people could publish book reviews by writing posts on their own blogs. It was called Spectacles and was deployed and working. But then I listened to a friend who said &ldquo;people don&rsquo;t read books anymore&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>About a month ago I decided to build a new app to attend a personal need, a desktop client for <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>, a service I&rsquo;ve been using for over a decade to store and manage my bookmarks.</p>
<p>As any application which requires internet to fetch and update data, my client needed a way to detect network accessibility. For a long time the strategy adopted by engineers in this situation was to rely on Apple&rsquo;s Reachability class, a sample code the company used to provide for download on their developer portal. Well, either that or one of the many CocoaPods frameworks the community built to replace Apple&rsquo;s drag-and-drop solution. But since iOS 12.0 and macOS 10.14 there&rsquo;s a powerfull first-party alternative.</p>
<p>Introduced a couple of years ago, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpathmonitor"><code>NWPathMonitor</code></a> is the easiest way to detect network changes (and retrieve connection properties). Its interface is extremely simple to use, providing a callback to get notified of updates.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>My application in built in SwiftUI (2.0) and Combine and the solution above wouldn&rsquo;t <em>feel right</em> in my View Model. So I started with a simple wrapper, hiding the monitor and exposing a publisher which notifies path changes.</p>

Turns out <code>URLSession</code>, familiar to every iOS/macOS engineer, is the perfect example since it requires <code>URLSession.resume()</code> to be called to fire the network requrest. Recently <code>URLSession</code> got a new method, a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/3329707-datataskpublisher">publisher</a> which starts the request at the moment there&rsquo;s demand (a subscriber):</p>

<p>The protocols <code>Publisher</code>, <code>Subscriber</code>, and <code>Subscription</code> are examples of these APIs. To implement a custom publisher it&rsquo;s necessary to implement types conforming to two of these protocols.</p>
<p>First, a quick recap:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher"><code>Publisher</code></a> is the type which emits events over time,</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber/"><code>Subscriber</code></a> is the type which receives events published by the publisher, and</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscription"><code>Subscription</code></a> implements the link between publishers and subscribers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step was to define my publisher interface. Since the monitor requires a queue to run, I decided to pass the queue as argument. In order to simplify its interface, a background queue is passed by default to the implementation.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#fff;background-color:#1f1f24;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#fc5fa3">extension</span> <span style="color:#5dd8ff">NWPathMonitor</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#fc5fa3">public</span> <span style="color:#fc5fa3">func</span> <span style="color:#41a1c0">pathUpdatePublisher</span>(
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        on queue: DispatchQueue = .global(qos: .background)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    ) -&gt; NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      <span style="color:#6c7986">// ...</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The interface provides a hint of the first type to be implemented, <code>NWPathMonitor.PathMonitorPublisher</code>. Most of the code is boilerplate, and for this publisher, the <code>Output</code> expected is <code>NWPath</code>, without a <code>Failure</code>.</p>
<p>When the publisher <em>receives</em> a subscriber, the link between them is established.</p>

			 <p>I strongly believe that the best way to learn something new is by experimenting and practicing it.</p>
<p>A few months ago I was studying <em>Functional Programming in Swift</em>. Swift is a modern, powerful, and safe language. Its syntax is so simple and elegant that it works as an invitation to dive into the Functional Programming world.</p>
<p>After practicing Functional Programming in Swift for a few weeks, I decided to try something a little bit different. I decided it was time to experiment with <em>curried functions</em>, <em>map</em>, <em>filter</em>, <em>sort</em>, and <em>reduce</em> in Objective-C.</p>
<p>Swift collections implement <em>map</em>, <em>sort</em>, <em>filter</em>, and <em>reduce</em>, so the first step on my experiment was to reimplement these in a <code>NSArray</code> category, trying to match the method signature that Swift implements.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Map</strong>: given a <em>transform operation</em>, it returns a new <code>NSArray</code> where all its elements are transformed according to the operation. The <em>transform operation</em> takes an object and returns another object (that might be of a different type of the original object).</li>
<li><strong>Filter</strong>: given a <em>condition operation</em>, it returns a new <code>NSArray</code> where all its elements satisfy the condition. The <em>condition operation</em> takes an object and returns a boolean.</li>
<li><strong>Sort</strong>: given a <em>sort condition</em>, it returns a new <code>NSArray</code> where all its elements are sorted according to the condition. The <em>sort condition</em> takes two objects and returns a boolean.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce</strong>: given a <em>combine operation</em>, it returns a recombined object by recursively processing its constituent parts. The <em>combine operation</em> takes the initial state and an object and returns a recombined object which is of the same type of the initial state.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>NSArray</code> category ended up with the following interface:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Where each movie contains a title, the actor’s name who played Bond, and some additional information about about the flick. The movie interface is defined as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#fff;background-color:#1f1f24;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-objc" data-lang="objc"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#fc5fa3">@interface</span> <span style="color:#5dd8ff">Movie</span> : <span style="color:#5dd8ff">NSObject</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#fc5fa3">@end</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><em>Sorting</em> the array of movies requires a <em>sort condition</em> that takes two movies and returns a boolean that represents the relationship between them. So, for sorting all the British Secret Service agent movies by budget:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#fff;background-color:#1f1f24;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-objc" data-lang="objc"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#fc5fa3">BOOL</span>(^byBudget)(Movie *, Movie *) = ^<span style="color:#fc5fa3">BOOL</span>(Movie *a, Movie *b) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#fc5fa3">return</span> a.budget &gt; b.budget;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>};
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>NSArray&lt;Movie *&gt; *moviesByBudget = [movies sort:byBudget];
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Simple.</p>
<p>For <em>filtering</em>, the method requires a movie and returns <em>true</em> when the movie matches the condition and <em>false</em> otherwise. Below, a simple way to create an immutable array containing the Sean Connery movies.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#fff;background-color:#1f1f24;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-objc" data-lang="objc"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#fc5fa3">BOOL</span>(^isConnery)(Movie *) = ^<span style="color:#fc5fa3">BOOL</span>(Movie *a) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#fc5fa3">return</span> [a.actor isEqual:<span style="color:#fc6a5d">@&#34;Sean Connery&#34;</span>];
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>};
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>NSArray&lt;Movie *&gt; *conneryMovies = [movies filter:isConnery];
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>But here is the tricky part. To filter movies played by other actors, more blocks like the one above would be required. The <em>functional</em> way to address this is using curried functions — popular technique in Swift (and in other Functional Programming languages).</p>
<p>Since <em>filter</em> expects a block that takes a movie and returns a boolean, another function is required, where its output is a function matching this signature.</p>
<p>The new function takes a string (actor’s name) and returns a function that takes a movie and returns a boolean.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#fff;background-color:#1f1f24;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-objc" data-lang="objc"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#fc5fa3">typedef</span> <span style="color:#41a1c0">BOOL</span>(^FuncMovieToBool)(Movie *);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>FuncMovieToBool(^isActor)(NSString *) = ^FuncMovieToBool(NSString *actor) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#fc5fa3">return</span> ^<span style="color:#fc5fa3">BOOL</span>(Movie *movie) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        <span style="color:#fc5fa3">return</span> [movie.actor isEqual:actor];
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    };
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>};
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>NSArray&lt;Movie *&gt; *actorMovies = [movies filter:isActor(<span style="color:#fc6a5d">@&#34;Daniel Craig&#34;</span>)];
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Without any changes to the <em>filter</em> method signature or implementation, it’s possible to filter the array of movies to get a list of movies played by any actor on the big screen.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s possible to combine all these functions to achieve the desired result. Let’s say I want the movies were Pierce Brosnan played James Bond, <em>sorted</em> by ratings and <em>reduced</em> to a list.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#fff;background-color:#1f1f24;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-objc" data-lang="objc"><span style="display:flex;"><span>NSArray&lt;Movie *&gt; *moviesByRatings

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>                                          initial,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>                                          movie.title,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>                                          @(movie.tomatometer)];
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    }];
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Voilà:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Brosnan movies sorted by ratings:
* GoldenEye (Tomatometer: 82)
* Die Another Day (Tomatometer: 57)
* Tomorrow Never Dies (Tomatometer: 57)
* The World Is Not Enough (Tomatometer: 51)
</code></pre><p>But putting all the fun and excitement aside, would I use these methods on an Objective-C project? Probably not — <code>NSArray</code> already implements methods for sorting and filtering arrays using <code>NSPredicate</code>.</p>
<p>My point here was to experiment and practice <em>map</em>, <em>filter</em>, <em>sort</em>, <em>reduce</em>, and <em>curried functions</em>. Programming requires practice. And practicing these techniques and methods (and reimplementing them) in Objective-C improved the way I use them in Swift.</p>
